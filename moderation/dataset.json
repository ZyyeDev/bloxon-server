I couldn\u2019t think of anything that could have caused her to react that way other than when I rolled my sleeves up to wash my hands, exposing my scars. I was kind of sad about it, but also felt it was slightly amusing since it seemed a more extreme response than I would expect. I left after I was done and went back to the frame shop where there was a man waiting. After helping him for a few minutes, that very woman came up to him. She was his wife. I had a completely normal conversation with the husband and the wife never did speak a word to me. I think if I didn\u2019t find it so bizarre, it would have affected me more, but it is weird how people view those who self-harm.\n\nThe primary way I self harm (though it certainly hasn\u2019t been the only way) is by scratching, so I\u2019m usually able to come up with stories such as getting a neighbor\u2019s cat out of a tree or getting caught on a thorn when working in the garden, neither of which I\u2019ve actually done. The scars don\u2019t even look like they came from a cat or thorn, so I\u2019m surprised no one has said anything. I think if you say something with enough confidence, and the fact that people are too lazy and/or not interested enough to really think about it, they just buy it. It can be exhausting though.\nAlthough I haven\u2019t had people (I can think of) look at me in any particular way since they seem to believe the stories I tell them about the scars, I\u2019ve had people give me looks and call me disgusting for the trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling) I struggle with.

I withdrew from my friends and stopped participating in the things I used to enjoy. I felt like I was just going through the motions of life and I didn't see the point in anything anymore.\n\nAround that time, I started seeing a therapist and she suggested I try some coping mechanisms other than self-harm. I tried a few things, but nothing seemed to work. I still felt empty and like I was just going through the motions.\n\nThen, one day, a friend of mine suggested I try playing the online game League of Legends. I had never played anything like it before, but I decided to give it a try. At first, I was terrible and got frustrated easily. But I kept playing and slowly started to get better.\n\nI found myself getting lost in the game and forgetting about my pain. It was a way to escape from my reality and into a world where I could be anyone I wanted to be. I slowly started to re-engage with my friends and even made some new ones.\n\nLeague of Legends gave me something to look forward to and a reason", "S": 0, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 0, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 0}

{"prompt": "Luckily I was drunk enough that I don't remember the fine details. I was camping at a local event, where a couple hundred or so college students get together and have party camp over memorial day weekend. Well i started getting tipsy, normally I'm pretty careful, but it was about 10 so it was getting dark. I decided to run back to my tent to get glow sticks and I slipped on some loose leaves. All I remember is hearing the nastiest pop I'd ever heard in my life. I just grabbed my leg and pleased to myself for my let to not be broken. Well there was nothing I could do about it then so I did what any drunken fool would do. I crawled into my tent and went to sleep. Good thing I brought my air mattress and had it filled to ideal pressure. The next morning I wake up (but not before two stumbling, drunken leaks on the ant covered tree next to our tent) and my ankle is twice the size of my other leg. I stay in bed a few more hours until my buddy wakes up and I tell him about it. He doesn't think it's broken because of how chill I'm being. So I try to get out of bed. He helps me over to the picnic table and I start just pouring sweat, my vision starts fading, he's telling me I'm turning green. That's when I knew it was serious. So I lay down in the backseat of his car and he takes me to the nearest hospital which was in Redding, CA about a thirty minute drive. So the bone wasn't the worst part. Apparently I tore most of the ligements and a couple tendons in my ankle so it's safe to assume I spent the last 2 months on my couch.\n\nTl;dr: Alcohol + running + loose leaves = a bad time.", "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 0, "V2": 0}

Me, my friend and mother were all involved.\n\nLuckily, I got the worst of the aesthetic injuries, but my mother broke her neck and had a stroke and such. She made a full recovery and is walking/talking to this day. My friend walked away with cuts and bruises. Everything in the car (electronics, clothes, laptops) survived, except the car itself. I'm extremely lucky that I walked away with an almost missing arm only. Don't know what caused the split though, whether it was just pressure from the car on top of it, or if it was a shard of glass tearing through.\n\nI was life flighted to Vegas where I got stitched up. My muscle had torn all the way through (that's all tendon and ligaments), and that had to be sutured, my skin was stapled back together. I got a skin graft about 2 months later and now it's almost fully healed.\n\nMore images of the following months [here in this album](<URL>\n\nRolling in a car is definitely an unreal experience. I constantly dream of the night that it happened, the rolling playing over in my head again and again. Luckily, a doctor and nurse were some of the first to stop and help. Definitely thankful for everyone who helped me.\n\nOh, and by the way, life flights cost about $44,000 in case you were all wondering. That and all my other bills amounted to ~$150,000 that night.

My other thigh has a very large and detailed dream catcher on it and you can still see the scars through the feathers on the bottom because of the light shading that was required.

{"prompt": "Preface - PLEASE READ!:This is the sixteenth part of what is a running story. It is all about the taboo. You will not find romance here. Any notion and talk of love is subverted to serve the taboo. Anal sex and incest are MAJOR themes of this story. You may want to not read this part and other parts if you take offence to any of the following in a lurid, obscene (and of course fantastical) context: incest, rough sex, submission and domination, degradation, extreme sodomy, ass worship, extreme dirty assplay, light or implied scat, farting, and EFRO (erotic female relieving observance). All characters involved are 18 or older. This particular story is a change from all that filthy anal that preceded it. <Person>'s ass needs a break - however brief! Instead, there is a strong impregnation fantasy (yes, fantasy) theme in this part. Again, I am thankful for all my readers, patient fans, and especially comments, ratings and emails. Hopefully one day, with your help, I may get one of my stories rated high enough to be 'Hot'. Very close but no cigar!P. S. The fantasy is everything. *It is the next day and the start of the holidays. You haven't done much since your particularly filthy last episode, except to squeeze your daughter's amazing curves while <Person> kissing her in the shower, your penis lodged deep in her butt, and doing something highly similar in the bedroom afterwards, <Person> falling asleep with her thumb in her mouth and her pink pyjama bottoms pulled just down enough to keep your softening penis still inside her bottom. The late morning light filters in the room through the curtains. You are freshly showered and towelling your hair, wearing another towel around your waist. You look up to see <Person> standing in the doorway in a little pink top and tiny panties with a cartoon kitten's face on them. Her hand is down them and you can see her moving her fingers around. 'Daddy, can you go in my little pussy?' she says, suddenly sounding rather shy and innocent. You look up at her smiling, and then change your face to mock shock. 'Honey, we can't do that, I'm your father!' you say, rather convincingly you think. <Person> giggles and then makes her face look upset and desperate. 'But daddy I neeeed it. It'll be fun I promise! You know you want to know what it's like inside your daughter's silly tight pussy. ' She steps closer. 'Of course I do -- I mean, no! Honey no matter how small and warm and wet your pussy is. . . ''Don't forget tight!''And super tight, I'm sure, the fact is that daddy's shouldn't do things like that, it's wrong. ''But wrong things are so, like, fun and cool and stuff! Am I not pretty enough daddy?' She steps right up to, and you put your hands on her waist. 'Of course you are silly! You're gorgeous and any man would find you completely fuckable!''Including you daddy?''Yes, I mean, well, we shouldn't even be talking like this!'She frowns. 'Is it because my boobies aren't big enough?''No! Honey your breasts are huge for your age, they look amazing! I bet all other girls are jealous. ''But you won't even touch them. ' She looks so sad. 'Because. . . because. . . It's not like that. . . 'She picks up your hands and places them on her breasts. 'There we go, now squeeze them. 'You do so, mauling them through her shirt with disguised delight. 'They do feel amazing baby, but I'm not sure we should be -''Maybe it's my ass, maybe you're another person that thinks my butt is too big and silly. ''Baby, your ass is amazing, it's perfect! I love how big it is!' You move your hands from her chest and clamp them to her ass, squeezing it hard and opening it up with your hands. <Person> smiles. 'Good good, maybe you can put it in my bum later too!''Baby now that's going too far! What kind of father would I be if I made love to my daughter's big bottom?''A great one! You know you'd love it, bumming your busty teenage daughter. ''I know I would honey, but I don't think you'd like it. ''I bet I would daddy. I bet I'd love to feel your big thing deep in my fat bum while you kissed me and told me how pretty I am. ' She is grinding her pussy on your knee at this point. You groan. 'Okay, okay, look. We can compromise. If I go in your pussy just for a bit, just for today, will you stop asking for all this stuff?''Maybe daddy!' She grins impishly. You sigh. 'That's the best I'll get. Right, let's pull these silly panties down and get you sorted. ''Yayy!' She claps her hands together and bounces on her heels. She wriggles as you help her out of her pants, moving them slowly over the stuck out largeness of her rear. You squeeze her ass over and under her panties, taking your time to remove them. She makes no effort to help you. 'I can't do it myself daddy, I need your help. ''Aw you silly baby' you say gently", "S": 1, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 0, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 0}

{"prompt": "was in shock, but I did as I was told. I opened my shirt, but <Person> ripped it open wider, popping the buttons in the process. \"Daddy, I haven't got another shirt to wear. \" <Person> just laughed. My tits were out on show and I was so red from embarrassment and humiliation, which seemed to make Dad's cock even harder. He started to maul my tits. \"Mmm, bitch, you have a fine pair of tits, now use them to jack me off,\" Dad said coldly. I pressed my tits together. \"Get your bra off, you dumb bitch!\" So off came my bra. I squeezed his cock between my tits and built up a rhythm. I started to enjoy it, and I opened my mouth to take his cock in my mouth like I did every day. Dad soon came in my mouth, and I swallowed as usual. I started to get up, and Dad said, \"Where do you think you are going now, bitch? You're a nasty little slut just like your mother, and we have to do something about it, don't we?\" I was wet between my legs as usual and Dad knew it. \"Now let's see that little virgin pussy of yours. and it had better still be a virgin cunt!\" Dad slapped me down to the floor. \"Did I tell you to get up bitch?\". I whined, \"But I will be late for school!\"\"Bitch! The only real lessons you need to learn I will teach you,\" Dad shouted to me. I was crying and semi-naked on the floor. Dad just laughed. \"You know bitch, sluts don't wear panties because they just get in the way, and from now on you don't wear any, either. Understand me?\". I just nodded as my tears stopped me from making any sense. Dad got me down on my knees, tore my shirt off my back, and ripped my skirt off me. All I had on was my pink little cotton panties with teddy bears on them, which were now completely soaking wet. \"Look at yourself, bitch. You're so fucking wet and you want it so much, so I've decided that I am going to take your virginity. . . . And I hope some pathetic little boy at school has not yet taken it. \" I shook my head. \"Good, good, bitch. \" He took his shirt off and I was amazed to see my Daddy was surprisingly very well physically fit. He had a powerful looking chest and six-pack abs, and this just made my cunt even wetter. Dad started to maul my body, and my body started to betray me. I was moaning like bitch in heat!Dad ripped off my panties and started to finger my cunt. \"You're so wet down there; I am just going to slid it in, bitch. Oh, and next time I want your cunt completely shaved,\" Dad told me. I was lost in lust and just moaned,\"Yes Daddy. \" My world was spinning and I was hopelessly and helplessly lost in it. I just watched as dad finger-fucked me\u2014he started with two and then stepped it up to four. I was so close to having my first real orgasm and Dad just carried on. He suddenly stopped. \"It's not about you, bitch. I am the one in control here. and this will always be about tending to my needs, not yours. Don't you ever forget that, slut!. \"Dad threw me to the floor. I was completely naked and soaking wet. \"Get on all fours\u2014just like when you suck me off, bitch!\" I got on my hands and knees and I presented my ass to him. \"Just like this Daddy?\" I asked, wanting to please him as no other woman had. \"You learn quickly. Now for your lesson, bitch. \" He was merciless as he put his cock at my entry and forced himself deep into me. I felt every inch as he ripped through my hymen without any regard for me at all. I would have screamed from the sheer pain of it, but my lust got the better of me. I was moaning, \"Yes. . . ! Yes. . . ! Yes. . . !\" This caught me totally unaware, but my mind was racing and I was totally lost in a strange, new world of pleasure that I found frightening, yet highly arousing. <Person> shot his seed deep inside of me. I was so happy that I was able to bring pleasure to my Daddy. I never even noticed that he had an evil look in his eye, and had absolutely no inkling what he had in mind for me later. I could go everywhere throughout the whole house, except the basement, which was always kept locked. . . . *how can i say it in words i'm honured to know you DragonSlayer and thanks again for your editing skills as i learn.", "S": 1, "S3": 1}

{"prompt": "or twice she had had this vision of a guy she'd never meet, perhaps in a foreign country, jerking off while looking at her, his thick cum splashing all over her photo. But she knew that was just a fantasy. . . )After her shower she decided to do something different and give <Person> a treat. She sat down on the edge of the bath, opened her warm soft thighs and carefully shaved every scrap of pubic hair from her. She knew <Person> liked feeling her like a very young teen and, after all, it was a special day. What surprised her was how exciting she found it. She sat for some time just stroking her little girl's cunt, feeling its smoothness. Her inner lips had disappeared while she'd been showering and so now all there was to see was a lovely soft pink slit between her thighs. She remembered how once before, while still at school, she'd sat on a bed admiring just such a slit between just such a pair of smooth thighs. Oh yes; she'd been so in lust with Candy that summer. . . She'd discovered so much about herself that year and even now she imagined from time to time that she could taste <Person>'s pussy. Her thick juices smelt so animal and when they made love her nose, mouth and chin were covered in <Person>'s fluids. She'd never dreamt that she'd ever allow herself to drink another girl's pee, let alone enjoy it, - but she did. Oh God, she'd adored <Person> and her piss had tasted like nectar as it splashed and dribbled all over her face - she just couldn't gulp enough of it to satisfy her desires. And the thrill of standing over a naked <Person>, opening her legs and emptying herself over her lover was almost too much to bear. She was so in love with <Person> - it was if her gushing pee was actually carrying her love and covering <Person> in her desire. Such memories, but such heartache when <Person> had to move away that fall. She thought she'd die sobbing. . . <Person> knew she couldn't allow herself another session on the bed, but she gave into another temptation. Her smooth pussy had excited her, so she fetched out the camera and took plenty of photos of her lovely nude body. Many were very explicitly concentrated on her cunt, both closed like a little girl's and gently spread to allow her inner lips to flower again. Others were of the whole of her, both standing in front of the mirrors in the bedroom and posing on the bed. By using the delay, she could take nice pics of herself from behind as she kneeled and spread her legs. She'd look at them when she was alone. Another excuse for a private session. . . She carefully saved the photos in her secret folder on the PC. God knows what she'd say if <Person> ever found them. It was a little sexy ritual she'd been doing for years. Heavens, tucked away carefully in her lingerie drawer she had Polaroids Candy had taken of her when she'd still been at school! God; <Person> would be so shocked to find those. He'd be so disappointed in her. . . And she knew what she was about to do. It was only sensible to check whether they were still safe. . . She felt to the back of her drawer and her finger closed around the packet with that familiar thrill. Just checking that they're still safe. . . Makes sense just to look inside to reassure herself that they're still all there. . . And there she was, from all that time ago. Her girly grin shining out down the years, love for her friend burning from her eyes. Kneeling on the bed, cupping her adolescent breasts (quite nice, even then, she noted!); here showing her butt and glistening pussy to <Person>; some more, close ups, with her fingers deep inside her; and then others, taken shortly after, with her licking her fingers. Nearly one hundred in total, documenting a few months' young love, exhibiting herself in eager but fairly unsophisticated poses for her beautiful lover. Oh God, even now <Person> could feel the ache in her belly. And here were the most explicit, taken only days before the crushing news that shattered that summer - a few pics of each of them licking the other's pussy. She remembered with a smile that they messed about with the camera's self-timer for ages to get those shots right - but she was still impressed with the results even now. The love shone out from their eyes and there was nothing posed about the enthusiasm - they couldn't have buried their mouths any deeper in their lovers' cunts. She could actually see <Person>'s juice glistening on <Person>'s nose in one shot. It was familiar, the mix of emotions whenever she took this journey back in time. Yes; her hand had strayed down and yes, her fingers were sticky again but it was almost a fondle for comfort. Of equal intensity was this longing, still, for a youthful intense love that had been denied them. True; she now enjoyed herself every week or so with India from the gym for a few hours but she knew that she'd never ever replace <Person> in her heart. That realisation served to put <Person>'s \"sensible head\" back on. She self-consciously gave a little cough; stood up sharply and gave herself a little talking to. Time was moving on and she had plenty to do to prepare for her special night with <Person>. To be continued. . .", "S": 1, "S3": 1}

{"prompt": "I'm so sorry hun. I kinda had a similar story when I was a freshman (14yrs) i thought i was such cool shit for dating a senior. But one day I had stayed after school to finish up a project with a classmate and when I came out he was just standing their waiting for me. Which was super unexpected I didnt even know he knew. The afterschool bus wasnt going to come for almost an hour so we walked around for a bit, and then he brought me into the theater room. He started kissing and groping me and I got scared. I kept making every excuse in the book, ie. I dont want to miss the bus, we could get caught, etc. And i was also visibly shaking which he even noticed and commented on. At this point we were on the stage but after he asked why I was shaking he tried to \"make me more comfortable\" and brought me down to the seats. He started touching me, but I did get kind of \"lucky\" in sense that he only sexually assaulted me and didnt penetrate and rape me. I think eventually he realized what he was doing and stopped and apologized. But when I got home I told my friend. She thought I was leaving parts out of the story and told her mom who worked at the school that he raped me. Her mom then told the principal and guidance counselor who got the authorities involved it became this huge thing. And all they ever kept asking me was if he raped me which he didnt so I said no. Eventually they had to drop it. But he told the entire school that I tried ruining him and falsely accused him.

{"prompt": "A child bride from Colorado recently came out to be interviewed, urging the state of Colorado to reconsider the age to wed. She herself was married at the age of 14 to a man who was 34 years old. A twenty year age gap between a man and, really a child, is quite alarming. The gap was so alarming, in fact, that state lawmakers banned minors from entering into common-law marriages in the year of their marriage in 2006. Ceremonial marriages were never addressed, though. So there have been over 2,200 underage marriages since 2006.\n\nThe fourteen year old\u2019s thirty-four year old husband was put in jail for sexual assault, which was not overruled by their marriage because a judge deemed it illegal. While they had parental consent for the marriage, they apparently did not have a judge\u2019s approval according to police and court records. The wife claims that she wishes she had never gone through with the marriage and stated that no one knows what they want or what love is at the age of fourteen. Eighteen should be the age limit for marrying, she encouraged.\n\nThe <Organization> has a set a goal of the year 2030 by which all child marriages should be illegal. While perhaps not all underage marriages are for sexual assault reasons or human trafficking, the ban will certainly help eliminate a vast number of cases where it is the underlying motive for the union.

If my partner changed their mind and told me not to pop a pimple of theirs that they had previously asked me to pop, I would back off immediately - and I have a compulsive disorder that makes me obsess over picking at and popping pimples!

Honestly, I would even say that because he touched you (and hurt you) when you didn't want him to, you would be fully justified in calling this assault, no matter how small it might seem to you. You'd call it assault if a stranger came up to you and tried to pop a pimple on your face while you begged them to stop, right?

{"prompt": "I think it is unethical to eat your own species. Also it carries the risk of contracting Prion diseases like CJD and Kuru, though if you avoid eating the brain you should be good. I don't think evidence of past infanticide and cannibalism justifies doing it currently. \n\nHowever, I see morality as a spectrum rather than a binary thing. If you are starving to death, you might aswell eat the baby as it won't survive on its own and you can just have another when resources are plentiful. Eating a human would be less ethical/more morally wrong than a working class animal, which would be more unethical than eating any random animal, which would be more unethical that eating a plant, which would be more unethical than just eating the fruit of the plant and dispersing the seeds, which could be considered a net positive.\n\nI think we can attribute the usefulness of a species to society as a contributer to its value. Ie, if you had to chose who to live, it would be morally better to pick a doctor over a murderer.\n\nAs for humans being of negative value. I think that damage we do is part of a cycle every intelligent species goes through on every inhabited planet, and a filter. If we don't smarten up and stop warring and destroying our environment, we won't survive. I think all our negative traits can be explained by evolution (greed, tribalism) and we need to overcome them to succeed. We are the only chance that Earth based life gets off the planet, weather it is synthetic biology, or from us seeding life elsewhere in the universe through terraforming (unless microbial life has already seeded life elsewhere). I think that everything living is made up of universe and exists within the universe, and is in a literal sense, the universe experiencing itself. A universe devoid of life is a sad thought. Therfore, more life, especially intelligent life is a good thing. Considering it took 4.6 billion years for life to evolve humans, and the sun only has about 4 billion years left (though it will prob make life on Earth impossible before then, maybe 2 billion years?), we are prob Earth based life's only chance to get out into the universe. \n\nI think nature is far more cruel than any human could be and that we have the possibility to lower the net amount of suffering in the universe. Though humans are part of nature too. One example of nature's cruelty would be cats. They kill things just for the fun of it and as far as we can tell, are incapable of empathy. By a humans standards (which it is unfair to judge a cat by), they would all be considered narcissistic psychopaths. Humans are capable of deciding to kill animals more ethically, while some animals like bears and hyenas will eat their prey while still alive and squirming. In this sense, it may even be reasonable to say humans are (one of) the only moral creature on the planet as we tend to empathize with the animals we kill and eat (at least in most cultures). Infact, we empathize with our prey so much, many humans become vegetarian by choice to lower tha amount of damage and suffering we cause (not me though).", "S": 0, "H": 0, "V": 1, "HR": 0, "SH": 0, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 0}

Keep it at full and I'll soak my panties in no time, you naughty boy. As she said that, I noticed a wet spot begin to grown in the crotch of her panties. The faster she frigged herself, the bigger the spot became. She was so close to my head, that I could smell her juices as they soaked her sexy silky panties. She was really working the vibrator on her clit and told me to watch as she was very close to losing it in her panties. She pressed the little bullet hard into now sopping panties and told me to look her in the eyes. When I looked up into her flushed face she began to cum hard in her silky panties. Her whole body shook with a tremendous force and the spot in her panties grew even bigger. She had so much juice it was running down into the crack of her ass, soaking her panties even more. When she finally came down from her cloud her panties were so wet, it looked like she had peed in them. \"When your mother gets overly excited, she squirts dear. You just made Mommy squirt in her panties, bad boy. They are thoroughly soaked and waiting for your load to join the mess I just made. \"She stood and slid her silky panties down her legs. As they pulled away from her wet pussy, I could see them sticking in her obscenely swollen lips. As she dislodged them, there was so much juice from her pussy that it strung from her openness as she pushed them further down her legs. When she had them in her hand, she took the soaking crotch and pushed it into her puffy lips wiping up every bit of juice she had just released from her womaness. \"Don't want any to go to waste. \" She said with a sly smile. \"I want to make sure they cling to your swollen cock. \"She knelt by the bed next to me and lowered the crotch of her dirty wet panties over my hugely swollen member. I could not remember being so hard. When they silky wetness came into contact with my throbbing cock, I almost shot off without even one single stroke. Her panties were so wet that the crotch clung like tissue paper to my large cock head. You could see my leaking piss slit right through them. She wrapped them around my cock and a large pearl of pre-cum pushed its way through the wet silken material. \"Mommy's boy really must want to cum. \" She cooed at the dollop of pre-cum as it joined her already wet panties. \"Stroke it for me. Let Mommy watch you cum in her filthy dirty panties. \"I wrapped my fist around my swollen cock and began to pump furiously into her very wet panties. She reached out with her long fingernails and began to lovingly tease my overblown balls. \"Let Mommy tease that nut out of you. Let me tickle those big bloated balls till they empty into my panties. \"She leaned in closer to my panty covered cock and had her lips so close to my swollen head that she was almost touching it. She stuck her tongue out and gently swiped it across the leaking head of my penis. It was all too much for me and I grunted deep in my throat and said, \"Mommy, I'm gonna cum in your dirty wet panties. I can't hold it any longer. Your panties are so naughty and you're teasing my balls so much!\"\"Go ahead. \" She said, \"Cum in <Person>'s panties. Show me how you fill them with your hot seed. Let that big pent up load go in <Person>'s panties\"She was using both hands on my balls now and I couldn't hold back any longer. With a grunt I began to cum hard in her panties. I looked down and watched as the first blast pushed through the wet material of her silky orange panties. To my ultimate surprise, she stuck her tongue into the large blob of cum clinging to her panties and lapped at the mess I was shooting. She just kissed and licked as my load kept cumming and cumming. Mom's lips were totally covered with my seed and her dirty panties were saturated. As my shots began to dwindle down, she loving kissed the head then sat back on her haunches licking up the mess I had deposited on her luscious lips. When all evidence of my nut had been consumed by my sexy ass mom, she stood and took the panties from around my cock cleaning it up as she did so. She held them up looking at the very wet messy crotch and then, much to my amazement, stepped into them pulling them back up her sexy legs and back into place over her still wet pussy. \"Mmmm,\" she said as she pushed my cum into her soaking pussy, \"these will come in handy later when I need to cum again. I'll let you know when that is so you can watch me make them even filthier. From now on, honey, just ask me when you need to pop a nut in my dirty panties. They are yours for the asking.

But it was a school night, and <Person> gave her an extra twenty, then watched as the weary teen shuffled down the hall to her family's apartment. Next, she looked in on <Person>.

Fuck!\" Suddenly alert, <Person> stumbled out of bed, tangling her feet in the blouse she had cast aside in the middle of the night. Kicking it away, she burst into the little girl's bedroom. There, still asleep, her daughter, her precious child. It was nine-thirty. In tears, the harried mom leaned back against the wall, her head thumping hard.

{"prompt": "Thank you for your thoughtful comment. \n\nI am sorry for the suffering you have experienced in life that you alluded to. The reason I brought up that rape and rapists are more common than we would like to admit, is to emphasis that this is a common experience and we are not the only ones. I agree with you that the guy whose picture you linked does look like a normal guy.\n\nWhen I wrote that it's a common experience, my thoughts were in the place of \"maybe it's just water under the bridge and I should forgive him and reach out since everyone makes mistakes.\" I don't think I can do that though.

I did report the incident to the police, so I don't imagine he will admit guilt any time soon.\n\nChild support is something that I have needed, but did not go for because the law has no protections for women whose child was conceived by rape. First, a rape conviction is rare, and even if there is a conviction, a judge will always listen to a request from a father who wants to spend time with his kid.

{"prompt": "sses that grow near the river mouth, under my feet. It was a struggle to get out of the water, while dragging 3 feet of chain. This was the Albanian coast, and quite hot at this time of year, so the fading light meant bugs!The gloom made it easier to stay unseen, while I looked for clothes. A child's swimsuit was left out to dry. Lucky it was a string bikini, or it would not have fit at all, but as it was, it made me look like a beach bunny, looking for a hookup. The top covered little more than my areolas, while the bottom became a thong when it was stretched to comer my hips. The next house had a dish towel, so I made a bit of a skirt, to gain some modesty. I did not trust the law enforcement in this area, so I could not just call for help. First, I needed to get the bolt out of the chain and cuffs on my wrists, and I had to pick a cheep lock on the shackles that held my wrists. The bolt proved the easiest. I hammered it with the base of a screw driver that I found on a patio set. It must have been hand tight, but it was a stronger hand than mine!An old wreck of a delivery truck gave me some light wire, and a private place to work on opening the handcuffs. The sun had set, when I staggered out to the highway. It was dark enough, that I had to walk about a mile, in bare feet, to a light at the corner, where the coastal access road met the coastal highway. Standing in the week light, I waited for a ride. Two guys in an old truck, decided that I was worth the risk, and pulled over for me. My outfit screamed hooker, and they couldn't understand a word I said. They kept indicating to their sleeping cabin, and nothing I did would persuade them to just let me have a ride. I got lucky having at least found truckers that use condoms! Self lubricating was smart too. I got into the cab with the older guy. He probably owned the truck, or just had seniority. He nervously took my little swim suit and dish towel off of me and sent his hands all over his new found treasure. He knew he had lots of time. I didn't expect my nipples to be that sensitive when he started lightly nibbling on one. The other one was being rolled, by a guy that was three times my age, and he was starting to turn my crank!At least I was safe, and warm. \"Vodka?\" I asked, after he blasted into my pussy. \"Vodka?\" I persisted, expecting them to know that one word of English. The old fucker pulled a jar out of a cubby hole, and handed it to me. I took a sniff, then a sip, then a couple of gulps as I felt the warmth spread through my aching body. The old guy was getting his strength back already. He probably hadn't enjoyed a woman in quite some time, so I took another big hit, and pressed back into him, hoping that I could relax, and maybe fall asleep as he worked me from behind. A few hours later I felt the big rig coming to a stop, and the other driver was anxious to have his turn in the fucking berth. This young guy was also fast. There would be no sleeping while he fucked me. His 6 inches was an easy accommodation for me, at any hole, but this guy loved it in missionary only. If his breath had been less toxic, it could have been a good time for all, but that was not the case. After he started pawing me, for the third time, I had to take him into my own hands. I pushed my way down to his penis and practically swallowed his cock. It was like I pushed a button on his back that jerked him into the full prone position, with arms at his sides. Now I saw that I could jump on top, and perhaps stay up high, riding him, but not having to smell his acrid breath. He reached up and squeezed my breasts while I raised and lowered myself on his modest tool. It took about 15 minutes but he squeezed another one into me, so I went down on him, hoping to finish him off for the night. I was just mechanically doing the work, while his breathing went from hard to grunting, and another dribble was added to his account, but he was done. He let me sleep for another hour or maybe two, but I woke to the feel of a penis entering my pussy. We pulled into a small restaurant right around first light, and I was offered breakfast in exchange for a round of oral. Well, cum was not an appetizer, but I was starved, and I knew these cocks fairly well by now, so why not. I did get pancakes for the trouble though. We had Athens ahead, and I could get to the American consulate there, so I just stayed with my new friends, all of the way. They pulled up, in front of the Security station, at the end of Embassy <Address>. When they helped me out of the rig, they handed me some currency, and kissed me like a loved one. The detail at the gate had to call in my name and photo, since I had no identification. They had a female come down from the Embassy, to do a strip search, but it seemed ridiculous to both of us, as I removed the garments. She took note of the bruising and swelling of my genitals and nipples, but I told her that it was just a misadventure, and I needed to get home. She nodded in understanding, and led me to the second building, which was the <Organization> Consulate.

{"prompt": "It was a long day at the office. I took the long drive back to Long Island from Manhattan, from my job as an interior designer for a private company. As a 40 year-old African-American female, it wasn't easy getting this position and status, I've certainly worked hard enough for it and now I'm indulging myself of everything I feel I deserve after all these years. I made the grueling trip and finally reach my town Babylon, N. Y, I drove straight for the mall just ten minutes away from my home. I got out of my car, locked the car doors and proceeded to the mall entrance, from the mall parking lot. Since summer was approaching I needed some cook wear and utensils, so I made my way to the basement of the department store. Spent nearly an hour searching for exactly what I wanted and stood on line and paid for my new items. I had enough of shopping and was ready to go home and as I approached my vehicle I got a strange feeling but quickly shook it off. I got in the car and looked at my rear view mirror when I was staring at a black male I tried to run but the stranger put a knife to my throat and told me to drive. I drove for what seemed like forever, but it was more like an hour. When we approached an off road, I was told to follow the road and I complied, when we reach the end of the road there was a cabin, I was ordered to exit the car and was told that no one was around so screaming would be useless. We got out and entered the cabin. The cabin was fully equipped and seemed like this man took some serious planning in this abduction. He told me to sit down and pointed to a chair, I sat and kept quiet. The tall man, black about thirty-five, 6' 5\" and about 240 lbs. asked what my name was, I said, <Person>. He said hello and not to worry that he wasn\u2019t going to hurt me just to relax and listen to what I was told. I said okay. He then led me to a bedroom where he told me to undress and lay on the bed. I did as I was asked to do. I was then handcuffed to the headboard and footboard, hands and legs. I asked that he\u201d please don\u2019t do this\u201d He answered saying that it was necessary and that he had to go out to run an errand. I was then left alone and fell asleep and when I awoke it was night. My husband I know must be frantic with worry. I prayed that I made it out of this so that I would see my family again. The man returned and was making a lot of noise outside the bedroom. When finally the doorknob turn slowly and I watched in horror, not knowing what was going to happen next. The man then un-cuffed me and told me to shower and directed to a well kept bathroom with all the essentials. When I finished he had laid out clothing for me or should I say lingerie, he told me to put it on, It was a black laced teddy with matching thongs. \u201d I dressed in the teddy\u201d. The man then introduced himself, calling himself <Person>. He told me that I reminded him of his deceased wife and that he knew my pattern and had been following me for weeks. He told me he wanted to make love to me and then he would decide whether to let me go. After he was done with me, but it all depended on my cooperation, if I gave myself to him completely. I asked what exactly did he expect from me and he answered,\u201d follow my lead and submit to me\u201d and then he said\u201d obey my every whim\u201d that last statement made me shutter in fright, and I had no idea what to expect. This man was sick, but I knew I had to survive for my family so I began to prepare myself for the inevitable. <Person> was quite charming though, making dinner for us and setting the table by candlelight, there were flowers and crystal and music, champagne as well. I was told to eat up, I think the food was take out though but it was good, consisted of roasted chicken, roasted potatoes and carrots and asparagus. \u201d After dinner <Person> poured champagne\u201d\u2026 and poured mine in a large goblet and told me to drink all of it. He cuffed me to the chair where I was sitting and told me he would be back. I heard the shower going and quickly looked around the room for an escape, but it was no use I was cuffed and he had the key. I quickly gave up the idea. <Person> was back in about fifteen minutes he was naked and sat on a nearby couch, looking at me a rubbing his member. He was a very dark man With long, thick cock, and I wondered if it would hurt me. I tried not to look at him but he told me to look at him and don\u2019t look away, I thought this is really sick.

Start small, really small. My goal this past week was to make it to the gym three times and I did that. Next week, I want to make it four. I'll take three, though. It's way, way better than zero!\n\n\n\nOne goal might be to think about the types of goals you want to set, and try writing some down. Don't worry about actually making these your real goals. Just toss ideas around. You may be surprised at what you will write down when you don't feel the pressure to actually make the goals happen. Just think about the things you might (MIGHT) like to do, and jot some time frames down. Some goals might be for this week. Others might be this year. Others might be just something you hope to do in this lifetime. Again, don't feel like you have to actually make these real. Just play->", "S": 0, "S3": 0}

{"prompt": "A quarter of a century ago, a small crack appeared on the facade of the Evil Empire, a crack that over the following years widened, despite some desperate efforts to plaster it over, and eventually became a giant fissure that brought the whole edifice down.\n\nIronically, it was one man's jump over a wall that nine years later led to the Wall coming down. On 14 August 1980, the discontent among the workers in shipyards of Gdansk, on the Polish Baltic coast, finally boiled over and a strike action commenced. A young electrician, who had been fired by the management for his political activity, has heard about the strike and climbed over the wall of the shipyard to join his friends and colleagues - and to quickly become their leader. His name was <Person>, and the rest is history - or, as <Person> would say - the end of history.\n\n(here are some\n\n, courtesy of <Organization>, via\n\n)\n\nI was only eight at the time, but I remember that my family had cut short out holiday by the sea when things started heating up in Gdansk. Everyone was fearing the repeat of 1970, when striking shipyard workers were suppressed with much bloodshed by the communist security forces. It didn't quite turn out that way - thank God - and even the martial law a year and a half later proved not to be particularly violent. The long revolution, which culminated in the events of 1989, was relatively bloodless by history's standards. Whatever the injustice of the communist oppression, Poles - and others - never resorted to blowing themselves, and others, up to press their political point. Yet, in the end, the victory was ours.\n\nIt's a sign of the times - and a closure of sorts - that <Person>, the wall jumper, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and one of the best known icons of the end of the twentieth century, has just announced that after the celebrations of the twenty fifth anniversary of the Polish August are over, he will be quitting \"Solidarity\". <Person> says that \"his\" \"Solidarity\" was a social movement, and now it has become simply a trade union run by a new generation of professional organizers (\n\nin Polish).\n\nGood, I'm thinking.

{"prompt": "in a way that I could use it to suck on her clit. This drove her crazy as she squirmed and moaned with pleasure. I continued to suck her clitoris while I inserted a couple of fingers into her dripping wet pussy. She went nuts as I slid my long fingers in and out of her while my tongue bathed her clit. She kept calling out my name and was really pulling my hair, I could tell by the way she was grinding her pussy into my face that she was getting close. Her gasps confirmed that as her breathing became very heavy and she was moaning and groaning. I was really working my tongue on her when she started letting out those really high pitched shrieks. I felt her body start to quiver as she pushed her pussy up into my face and began to orgasm. I could feel her juices flowing and I lapped up every drop I could. When she reached her climax she pushed my face away as her body writhed in ecstasy on the bed. I wanted to continue to eat her but she wouldn't let me. After a couple of minutes her climax ended and my dick was rock hard. She saw this and told me that she wanted me to fuck her with that big dick of mine. I climbed on top of her and slid the length of my dick back and forth over her wet pussy lips. She didn't want to have anything to do with my teasing her and she reached down, grabbed my cock and placed the head right against her pussy and thrust her hips upward, at the same time I pushed down into her and she let out a scream. \"Oh Shit\" she said, \"that feels so good baby, fuck me hard\". Being the loving nephew that I was I was more than happy to oblige my favorite aunt. I lifted the weight of my upper body onto my hands so I had leverage so I could fuck her nice and hard like she wanted. She lifted her legs up into the air so her pussy was completely exposed to me and I fucked her with really long and hard strokes. I still remember the slapping sounds we were making as our bodies collided with one another. I was really enjoying this but I had another position in mind. She had such a beautiful ass I wanted to fuck her from behind. I slid my cock out of her and told her to get on her hands and knees. She must have been reading my mind because in no time she was ready and waiting for me. She looked so good as she had her back arched, face in the pillow and her perfect ass up in the air. I positioned myself behind her and placed my hands on her hips as I slid the full length of my dick inside her eager pussy. I felt her pushing back on me as I started sliding in and out of her. We started to fuck with a real passion as she met every one of my thrusts with one of her own. The sight of her ass jiggling each time our bodies connected was something to behold. It turned me on so much I fucked her that much harder. I reached down and grabbed a handful of hair and used it to pull her back onto me. This made her back arch so much more than it already was, it was perfect. I wish I had a camcorder rolling because this would have been as good as any porno I've seen. Our bodies bucked as we started to fuck even harder. I grabbed her by both ass cheeks and squeezed her exquisite cheeks with my big hands. I took my right hand and started spanking her on her left ass cheek. This really turned her on because she got even more vocal when I did it. So I spanked her even harder. It was something, seeing her milky white ass turn beet red. I started to get that feeling in my balls so I started to slow down a little in order to try and make this last as long as I could, but she wanted none of that. She told me to keep fucking her, she said \"I want you to cum deep inside me baby. \" I could hear her breath quicken as she started panting and I kept fucking her hot pussy as hard as I could. It became almost frenetic as I was on the verge of coming. \"I'm about to cum Aunt <Person>. \" She said \"Go ahead baby\" as I let loose shooting my load into her. The feeling of my cum inside of her must have set her off because she came just after I did. I had never made love to a woman the way we just did. After we both came I just laid on top of her for a little while. I was completely amazed that I had just fucked my Aunt <Person> here in her own bed. Anyway, common sense got the better of us both as we realized that we had better not lay there much longer so we washed up a straightened ourselves up so that no one would suspect anything when they got home.

{"prompt": "If you are a beginner in this area, and you do not know whether you should consider airsoft rather than paintball, we prepared this article for you. Below, you will find some of the crucial advantages that airsoft offers to its players which makes it a much more popular option compared to paintball.\n\n1. The real look of the airsoft of the weapon\n\nWhen it comes to the crucial difference between the airsoft and the paintball, we must highlight the weapon selection. In the airsoft, the weapon looks like a real gun. This goes to the point that airsoft weapons need to have a special 6mm orange pointer at the end in order to be recognized as a weapon made for the airsoft.\n\nMany things give the confusion and make the appearance of the airsoft guns so similar to the real ones, including the equipment, design, strength, and potential. If you are interested, you can check <URL> and see a big selection of various airsoft weapons. If you plan to start with airsoft activity, you should find the propel weapon for you. When you are choosing, you need to search very well for the one that will suit your needs, and that\u2019s the reason why a wide range of options is so beneficial.\n\n2. The precision of the airsoft gun shooting\n\nWhen it comes to the airsoft bbs, they are much smaller than paintball pellets which means they are more resistant to the wind. As a result, their precision is better. Despite that, if you already played paintball, you probably noticed how big paintball pellets are.\n\nMore precisely, you can see them flying towards you, so you have time to hide and avoid them. On the other hand, airsoft bbs are so small, which means they are not noticeable. This is one more thing that influences the precision of airsoft guns. In other words, the hit percent is a lot bigger in this case.\n\n3. Airsoft gives you a feeling that you are in a real battle\n\nOne", "S": 0, "S3": 0}

{"prompt": "Frankly, speaking as a feminist, I'm mostly in agreement with you. Reproductive rights are important across the board, and men should have a fair deal of choice when it comes to it.\n\nHowever, I still want to introduce some nuance here.\n\n* There's a pragmatic concern here related to the welfare of the child. We don't want mothers and children living in poverty, and that has historically been a widespread problem that carries other social ills. Child support was invented as a measure not to say \"punish\" men, but rather to ensure that children were at least fed, clothed, housed and educated to prevent the suffering and social problems associated to lacking these things in early childhood. \n\n* As a corollary, I would require the introduction of robust child welfare programs to guarantee that, absent child support, the child will still have chances to do well and the mother won't fall into poverty. This includes things like free childcare programs, food assistance, and programs not unlike the Finnish baby boxes. I would still make these available to couples raising children together, though.\n\n* Like you said, it is important that all parental rights be abdicated in cases that the father wishes to abstain from child support. It is also important that the father be \"duly notified\" of the pregnancy. I think the mother would have to demonstrate clear attempts to contact and notify the father within some specified timeframe. \n\n* Like you also kind of said, in many ways, raising a child is more onerous than a pay cut, in that it involves a lot of unpaid, thankless labor. This in itself creates an asymmetrical relationship between the burdens placed on each parent, and this in turn has to be considered when trying cases related to \"financial abportion\". This is why forcing women to \"take responsibility\" for an accident is placing a much greater burden on them than child support would be. <Person> broadly, I agree with you that options for men should exist, but you are obscuring the asymmetrical nature of the issue.\n\n&gt; anyways, the new stream for lot of these thots is to get pregnant from a rich guy and then use the baby to make money.\n\n* While I'm not going to deny that this may happen, I think this narrative is likely over-inflated by confirmationa dn salience bias. I would question what exactly is the prevalence of this, especially considering most young women aren't even on onlyfans and (even though women are more likely to date older men) [most young women date men of their own age.](<URL>\n\n&gt;Pls Don't look at it from ur perspective of morality because morality is entirely subjective and to u abortions might be moral\n\n* This is very silly. Morality is subjective, but that doesn't mean literally anything goes, or that we can't have valid points to make about it. You clearly are already looking at it from a moral perspective when you said something is \"fair\" or \"unfair\".

{"prompt": "Rather than accepting that 200k is fucking insane for an ex council house, and accepting that everyone who had their nose in the trough must now pay the price for their participation in the housing ponzi scheme\u2026 we have apparently decided to prop it up still further and increase people\u2019s ability to get into debt that they will never be able to clear. Just last night I was porking this skank, and she told me that ten years ago she only owed \u00a35,000 mortgage on her house, today she owes \u00a375,000 ON THE SAME MOTHER-FUCKING HOUSE and can\u2019t afford the fucking internet, only in her case she got divorced and her \u201closer\u201d ex-husband got 30% of the house value as settlement\u2026 yaaay, but the fact is it is usually the other way around, it is usually the \u201closer\u201d ex-husband who gets none of the asset value and still gets loaded with the debt. If you exclude the fact that this skank got skinned by her ex, her story is quite normal, this City is full of skanks who divorced men having paid off half the mortgage, stiff the ex-husband with the repayments by way of alimony and child support, and then go out and get second and third mortgages up to 110% of the \u201cvalue\u201d of the place at the peak of the housing bubble. Yes folks, this is the unspoken truth about the UK housing bubble, most of this soon to be negative equity property is occupied by women, who have been busy re-mortgaging to use the place as an ATM, and so a house price crash will disproportionately affect the wimminz\u2026 let\u2019s face it, a single guy can be as happy as anything in a 1 bedroom place, but UK housing stock contains almost no 1 bedroom places, the vast majority is 2 or 3 bedroom, largely occupied by <Person> and the ex-children of men, and sometimes their new live in lover. So, what\u2019s the catch / point? While negative equity can be an enormous problem for a man, he is after all working and can come to some sort of financial arrangement with the bank, even it it means selling the new car and buying a clunker and cutting his expenses for a few years. Put a wimminz in negative equity and it isn\u2019t an enormous problem, it is game over, the bitch can\u2019t earn any money except by divorcing a man and ransoming his kids, so there is no further economies to be made and no future income to be used to pay down the burden, besides which the wimmins are only interested in more free house-as-an-ATM money for more ponies. So a housing price crash represents not just the financial pigeons coming home to roost, but doing so to two different classes of society, the wimmins, who have most of the houses, and are absolutely not prepared to downgrade or downsize or make any economies of any kind whatsoever, and the men, who are just as likely to say fuck it, quit work, declare themselves bankrupt, and sign on the dole. If that happens then the <Organization> collapses financially, and ALL the wimminz entitlement programs come crashing down, and nobody in government today or recently will get re-elected, either by the wimminz or the men. The fact is that the financial situation that the UK is in is so serious that there is no way of avoiding the pain, and every attempt to delay addressing the issue and facing the pain, and most importantly making those who were most irresponsible suffer the greatest losses, is simply going to make the final reckoning even more painful. And of course, any rebuilding of society and reduction of debt can only be achieved via men and their production of work and value, so these delays not only unfairly distribute most of the pain to those who were not irresponsible in the first place, the men (who did not want a new fucking kitchen every three fucking years, not as though the bitch could boil an egg anyway) but also delaying and therefore maximising that pain for the not irresponsible men, while yet again protecting the fucking wimminz, who will be whining that it ain\u2019t for them, it is for their childruuuun\u2026\n\nInteresting times ahead for sure, and painful, but not as painful for me as the wimminz, no sireee\u2026 bring it on.", "S": 0, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 0, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 0}

{"prompt": "I think you are misunderstanding why people focus on the violence perpetuated by the West. I say all this recognizing that the 'West' is a faulty, reductionist term. \n\nFirst, Western countries are richer and more powerful than other countries. Because of the industrial revolution, the West had an unparalleled military advantage which allowed them to colonize the world whether through direct empire or informal empire. \n\nSecond, colonization and its effects are directly relevant to what is happening right now. The age of colonialism only ended less than 100 years ago, that is EXTREMELY recent. To solve modern problems we have to focus on understanding the causes. If you think that the effects of colonialism will dissipate within 100 years you have a decently bad sense of historical perspective. \n\nThird, the very fact that people criticize the West more is indicative that they are more open and democratic, more able to own up to their mistakes. People who criticize the legacy of imperialism of the West are, in my view, those who ACTUALLY want to make their countries better and more humane. The apologists, I think, are the ones who feel guilty and have projected too much of their identity upon their nation.\n\nFourth, there is a selection bias. Americans care about criticizing America. Europeans criticize Europe. It makes absolute sense for Westerners to criticize their countries and their history and because of the spread of Western culture abroad, it makes absolute sense that the world will be more aware about the history and politics of the West , particularly the US.\n\nThe overfocus on the crimes of the West makes sense because Western countries are the richest and most powerful, they have the most educated citizens. You used examples about the Ottoman Empire and the Mongols. And yes, EVERYONE, including leftists and 'woke' people recognize that the world was way more violent than it is right now. We are better now. We don't accept the use of violence anymore the way we used to. All of this is good. It means we are moving forward and we are becoming more humane and we are becoming more critical of the horrible history we have inherited. My problem with your argument is that it implies that because we are better now, we should like just stop our critiques but no! We have to continues because that is the only way to make the world better. Don't settle only because we are better than the past because that is a very low bar.

{"prompt": "After reviewing specifications, speaking with an independent electrical engineer, and conducting a life cycle cost analysis, we selected a 28 watt bulb with extremely low mercury content. The 28 watt bulb was more expensive than the 32 watt bulb, and we were initially concerned about reduced light levels that might be associated with lower watts. However, we were pleased to learn that the 28 watt bulb had better performance characteristics than our standard 32 watt bulb and that light level expectations should be very comparable. We were also pleased to learn that the 28 watt bulb we selected had one of the lowest mercury levels in the industry and longer expected service life than the 32 watt bulbs being replaced. It\u2019s beyond the scope of this column to discuss mercury\u2019s role in fluorescent lighting and its environmental implications. For a comprehensive review of fluorescent lighting technology, see the following Wikipedia entry:<URL> [Or read the <Organization> article, \u201cWhy Recycle Used Bulbs?\u201d by <Person>, August 2007, page 18.] A reduction of four watts per bulb (12%) might seem like a minor efficiency improvement, but lighting represents a significant percentage of an office building\u2019s electrical consumption. It\u2019s also important to recognize the double benefit associated with lighting improvements, since reductions in lighting energy decrease the cooling load on HVAC systems. Using our average electricity cost (in cents per kWh), we became convinced the energy savings and longer life associated with 28 watt bulbs would justify the cost premium (compared to the 32 watt bulb); we also calculated that the electricity savings over the life of the new bulbs would actually pay for the entire cost of re-lamping (including labor and bulb recycling fees). In other words, this was a project that would conserve energy while completely paying for itself over the life of the new lamps. The cost analysis didn\u2019t even include HVAC savings or productivity improvements for our staff (who won\u2019t be replacing so many burned out bulbs each week). At this point, you might be wondering why we went for the field goal (with a 28 watt bulb) instead of the touchdown (the 25 watt bulb).

In advance of Monday\u2019s meeting, we also continue to collect additional data to aid the discussion. This meeting will be broadcast on <Organization> Channel 117.6 or 16, and view the Zoom link on the <Organization> webpage. There may or may not be action taken at the meeting regarding next steps, however it is important that the conversation occurs. There are many perspectives and opinions regarding when to move back to fully in-person learning and as we look into the future, it is important for us to have these discussions so that we can take the many considerations before us into account and be fully prepared for a move whenever it is possible. Thankful for your continued support of our students during this challenging year. 12/29 UPDATE: Due to the incoming winter storm, there will be NO in-person pick-up on Wednesday, Dec. 30. Instead, all meal sites will serve meals today for both Tuesday, Dec. 29, and Wednesday, Dec. 30. There will be no meal service on Thursday, Dec. 31, or Friday, Jan. 1.", "S": 0, "S3": 0}

I\u2019ve never in my entire life loved jews, but I do admit that I treated them with a double standard. I was very sympathetic because of the holocaust and this was due to programming.

If anyone, because of some duty assigned him, has to assume the role of leader, let him not be over-bearing, but rather indicate what has to be done.

The real motive is passion. One has to pay the penalty for it to God and to shed many tears over it 338. What good can come from fasting and abstaining from meat when we devour our brothers? He who commits detraction eats the flesh of his brother, chews on the flesh of his neighbor. Thus, St. <Person> speaking to the faithful says: If you go on biting and devouring one another, beware that you are not consumed by one another [Ga 5:15]. Let no one say that he commits detraction only when he utters what is false and when he slanders. When you backbite a confrere, even if what is said is true, you are culpable.

Before I'd arrived, I had completed several financial disclosure forms. Where did I get the money for my Mustang? Did I work in <Organization> School? For whom & how much was I paid. Would I be working in College? If so, for whom. Man these guys wanted to know everything but my jock size. They really had a fit when I indicated I would be living off campus. They even made <Person> complete some documents and confirm her income. Thankfully, prior to the start of school, I'd arranged a job through my <Organization> coordinator, <Person>. When I first met <Person>, I was only told he was a wealthy school supporter and owned several businesses. At our first lunch meeting, I stressed to him the need to be on the up and up as I did not want to risk my eligibility. He told me not to worry; part of his responsibility was to ensure I stayed eligible but at the same time did not suffer financially. He suggested he could find a job for a family member who could then provide me with an allowance. I noted I had a job which would fund most of my expenses; but I thought it might be a good idea for <Person> to have a job to occupy her time. I mentioned she was my recently divorced Mom; young and fresh for her age; great attitude; and I wanted to keep working on improving her self esteem. Without going into details, I mentioned the divorce was the result of an abusive Dad. <Person> mentioned he might have a position for her in one of his businesses and invited me to bring her to his house that Saturday for a barbecue. I agreed and he gave me directions to his home which was out in the country. We arrived at his house that Saturday around 2:00. It was out in the country with no other house in site. As we pulled into the driveway, I noticed the lack of other guest cars. But that thought quickly left my mind as I walked around the car to open the door for <Person>. As I assisted her in alighting from the car, I cautioned her not to embarrass me or disobey. She asked how she could be disobedient to her Master.

We walked up to the door; she was on my left with her hand on my arm and one pace to the rear. She rang the door bell. The door was opened by a sexy looking black female; about 40 or so I guessed. She was wearing a thong bottom and little more than some jewelry. She introduced herself as <Person> and indicated she was one of <Person>'s personal employees. Seeing her perky titties, I could understand that. She escorted us through the house and out to the rear yard with patio and swimming pool. <Person> was engaged in a conversation with 3 other black dudes; all were wearing skimpy speedo bikinis.

I turned to <Person> and told her to remove her dress so the others would not be uncomfortable. As she shed it, I noticed <Person>'s male friends liked what they saw. I told <Person> to make herself useful as <Person> and I withdrew to have a private conversation. I can put her to work this week. He noted she appeared to have a great attitude; but was concerned about how she would act in his topless bar. It catered to Blacks and she would be one of the few white dancers.

The truth was that she\u2019d had a crush on him since she first laid eyes on him and she suspected that it was part of the reason her other relationships had never worked out. <Person>, <Person>, <Person> \u2013 they were all great, but her mind constantly went back to <Person> and all of the what if\u2019s and questions that she had. She never thought anything would happen \u2013 after what happened with <Person>, she was sure he\u2019d hate her. It was partially her mother\u2019s fault and she\u2019d understand if he blamed her, too.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was going to tell you tonight,\u201d <Person> replied, his voice small. \u201cI\u2019m moving in with <Person> permanently \u2013 well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be permanent, but I\u2019ll be here for longer than two weeks \u2013 so I was hoping we could see each other, but if you\u2019re with <Person> I \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not with <Person>,\u201d <Person> interjected, cutting him off.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re literally wearing his t-shirt right now,\u201d <Person> replied.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a one-time thing,\u201d <Person> explained. \u201cWe met online, I didn\u2019t even know he was the <Person> until ten minutes ago. I was just bored and lonely and I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever like me, so I was trying to move on. It didn\u2019t mean anything, it was just physical\u2026\u201d she stopped talking as a grin spread across <Person>\u2019s face. Her cheeks felt warm. \u201cI have an early class today, so\u2026 I\u2019d better go. Text me,\u201d she said before running back into <Person>\u2019s room, where he was still sleeping soundly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<Person> wasn\u2019t in the living room when <Person> emerged, so she quickly slipped out the front door. She felt her phone vibrate in her pocket when she sat down on the bus and grinned when she saw the text from <Person>.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCan\u2019t wait to see you tonight :)", "S": 0, "S3": 0}

We considered a hot tub and champagne or ginger ale but they are non available. Any ideas? The Party Girl's advice is: Maybe you could try some of these: Here's a fun one, no pressure, easy to prepare and do, and can easily tie into your angel theme. Buy or make some baker's dough - enough for everyone. (Recipe: 4 cups flour, 1 cup salt, 1 3/4 cups water, mix and divide into 10 parts. You can color the dough with food coloring if you prefer. Make more if needed for more players.) Give each player a section of dough and ask them to make something that will occur in the future like a new animal or a futuristic house. Have them set their completed projects on a long table for everyone to admire. Then give awards for: funniest, most imaginative, silliest, best use of play doe, etc! Why not have a talent show. Tell people to prepare something for the party and then video tape it and show it to the guests. Everyone must participate to really make it fun. Start off with a blown up picture of <Person> Time and play a game of Pin the beard. Set up a Treasure Hunt in one of the houses and cute poems as clues. Get one of those great box mystery games and everyone be a character. <Person> asked: Occasion: millennium\n\nI have just been elected by my husband and sisters, to throw a Millennium party.

I'm not rich, but would like to find some great party favors, recipes (food & drink) that will be unusual and not just another family get together of partying. Can you help?

{"prompt": "Carmina Burana \u2014 at least the first part, \u201cO Fortuna\u201d \u2014 is probably one of the most immediately recognizable lyrics we\u2019ve discussed so far in this class. It\u2019s in all sorts of media \u2014 TV, films, film previews, sometimes it\u2019s sampled in other music, and so on. So, of course, it does immediately bring to mind a few things in particular; most notably for me, when I hear \u201cO Fortuna,\u201d I think of the battle in Helm\u2019s Deep from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, despite its prevalence, it has never occurred to me to look up the lyrics themselves or its incarnations prior to <Person>\u2019s arrangement from the 1930s.\n\nLooking at the lyrics now, both in their original form and translated, it\u2019s actually a bit more confusing than I anticipated. The general message of the lyric at the start seems to be to do with how quickly luck changes from good to bad; the cruelty of an immutable fate; a request from the speaker to their audience that they mourn said cruelty alongside them. However, it\u2019s pretty long and winding; while the lyrics turn back to the initial song several times, they are interspersed with love songs, borderline erotica, drinking songs, something a bit nonsensical about a roast swan, and odes to the seasons. The winding and not always coherent theme behind the lyrics as a set is kind of jarring to read when compared with the solemn, dramatic tone of \u201cO Fortuna\u201d in particular.\n\nAnother of the things that jumps out to me is the rhyme scheme/ meter; It\u2019s not particularly remarkable but again, I had never really considered the rhyme scheme prior to reading the lyrics. The <Person> version I\u2019m familial with is very grand, orchestral, done by a rather melodramatic-sounding choir; it doesn\u2019t seem to leave much room for whimsy, or rhyme, and the meter of the words sort of gets lost behind the sounds of the rest of the song.->", "S": 0, "S3": 0}

{"prompt": "Due to continuous wars knights are regularly called to battle to serve as heavy cavalry. As this has them engaging enemy forces in close-quarters combat (whether mounted or not) each knight wears a full suit of armor. These cover the soldier from head to toe, and while not at all cumbersome they are custom made and reserved for aristocratic knights.\n\nDue to a generation of warfare and a now-limited number of men able to fight, noblewomen have stepped up to the role of battle. Despite much grumbling from the more conservative lords in court, the women have proven quick studies and capable fighters. Indeed, as they wear the same functional armor a man might, it can be difficult, on the battlefield, to discern the unnecessary detail of whether the sword coming down from one\u2019s enemy is from a man\u2019s or woman\u2019s hand.\n\nEach nation uses heraldry and coats of arms to distinguish its warriors on the battlefield. Of these, a m\u00eal\u00e9e \u00e0 trois drives the majority of relations in modern campaigns. Stags, lions, and falcons have become something of slang terms to describe each faction.\n\nDaily life in the war (at least for these aristocratic ladies) involves much of what it does for the men: sword fights, warfare and tactics, castles and supply, and rules of kings, queens and treaties. At least one country has also made progress in using jousting as a tournament stand-in for bloodier conflicts, sparing their population from further needless bloodshed through the use of a few extraordinarily trained warriors, with mixed results.\n\n(I do not own the images in the above collage, and all copyrights belong to their respective owners.)\n\nGo to another world \u2026\n\nAdvertisements->", "S": 0, "S3": 0}

(And the correct trigger groups: We (at least I) don't take the selectors into account, since in most games you cannot even see them, or are set to safe while the gun goes all rock&roll.)- bozitojugg3rn4ut 07:55, 26 October 2011 (CDT)\n\nWell, yeah, the universe of Tom Clancy is the one where the prototypes and ultra rare things come true, including weapons and vehicles, so the presence of AR-15-type firearm with four-position selector switch shouldn't come as surprise ;) --<Person> 08:48, 26 October 2011 (CDT)\n\nBozitojugg3rn4ut, the selector really should be taken into account, as apart from the receiver markings the selector switch is the only external difference between the regular Colt carbines and the Enhanced version with burst and auto. If it has the regular fire selector and lacks the markings on the receiver, then it is simply and M4 with the wrong fire control group. Is very hard to tell from the Ghost Recon screen shots as there aren't any of the relevant side, but you can just make out that there are only 3 positions marked on the right side of the receiver, making the physical model that of a regular M4/M4A1 rather than an Enhanced M4. --commando552 09:09, 26 October 2011 (CDT)\n\nInterestingly, this discussion is the first result when one Googles \"Colt Model 978\". <Organization>", "S": 0, "S3": 0}

This study is focused on the utility of trie-based data structures for indexing discrete sets that allow to detect such a state faster. An empirical evaluation is performed in the context of index operations executed by a label setting algorithm for solving the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints. Numerical simulations are run to compare a trie with a HATtrie, a variant of a trie, which is considered as the fastest inmemory data structure for storing text in sorted order, further optimized for efficient use of cache in modern processors. Results indicate that a HAT-trie is better suited for indexing sparse multi dimensional data, such as sets with high cardinality, offering superior performance at a lower memory footprint. Therefore, HAT-tries remain practical when tries reach their scalability limits due to an expensive memory allocation pattern. Authors leave a final note on comparing and reporting credible time benchmarks for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints.

Would I be working in College? If so, for whom. Man these guys wanted to know everything but my jock size. They really had a fit when I indicated I would be living off campus. They even made <Person> complete some documents and confirm her income. Thankfully, prior to the start of school, I'd arranged a job through my <Organization> coordinator, <Person>. When I first met <Person>, I was only told he was a wealthy school supporter and owned several businesses. At our first lunch meeting, I stressed to him the need to be on the up and up as I did not want to risk my eligibility. He told me not to worry; part of his responsibility was to ensure I stayed eligible but at the same time did not suffer financially. He suggested he could find a job for a family member who could then provide me with an allowance. I noted I had a job which would fund most of my expenses; but I thought it might be a good idea for <Person> to have a job to occupy her time. I mentioned she was my recently divorced Mom; young and fresh for her age; great attitude; and I wanted to keep working on improving her self esteem. Without going into details, I mentioned the divorce was the result of an abusive Dad. <Person> mentioned he might have a position for her in one of his businesses and invited me to bring her to his house that Saturday for a barbecue. I agreed and he gave me directions to his home which was out in the country. We arrived at his house that Saturday around 2:00. It was out in the country with no other house in site.

What factors are considered in determining treatment? Factors to be considered include the size of the bleed, type and location of aneurysm, and the overall health of the patient. \n\n \n\n\n\n A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a type of stroke caused by bleeding in the space around the brain. This space is called the subarachnoid space, and it contains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds and cushions the brain.\n\nThe most common cause of a SAH is the rupture of an aneurysm. Aneurysms are weak spots in the blood vessels that supply the brain. They are usually caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and they can occur without any warning signs.\n\nOther causes of SAH include trauma to the head, bleeding disorders, and use of certain medications.\n\nThe symptoms of a SAH can vary depending on the amount of bleeding and the location of the bleed. They may include a sudden, severe headache; nausea and vomiting; stiff neck; blurred vision; loss of consciousness; seizures; and paralysis.\n\nA SAH is a medical emergency, and it requires immediate treatment. The goal of treatment is to stop the bleeding and prevent further damage to the brain.\n\nThe most common treatment for a SAH is surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the location and size of the aneurysm. In some cases, the aneurysm can be repaired with a coil or clip. In other cases, the aneurysm <DateTime> need to be removed.\n\nOther treatments for a SAH include embolization and medications. Embolization is a procedure in which a small device is inserted into the aneurysm to prevent it from rupturing. Medications can be used to reduce the risk of rebleeding and to help control the symptoms.\n\nIn some cases, a watchful waiting approach may be used. This is usually only an option for people who are not experiencing any symptoms.\n\nThe decision about which treatment to use will be made by a team of doctors.

The goal of negotiation is not necessarily to reach an agreement, but to improve the never-obtainable conditions for an agreement, that is, it reduces uncertainty and risk . Negotiation occurs in a variety of places such as commerce (buying and selling), politics, between individuals, etc.\n\nNegotiation is not just an agreement to complete a task together, but the building of social capital . The investment in relationships with others builds trust. Trust and cooperation are essential to creating \"win-win\" situations for all parties involved. Therefore it is necessary that negotiations be taken seriously and performed appropriately (Figure 1).\n\nOne of the most important aspects to a negotiation is that it includes some element of disagreement. When disagreements are present, the possibility of an adversarial relationship between parties becomes more likely. In negotiations, usually one side prefers a collaborative strategy while another party prefers a competitive strategy. The competitive nature of American society makes the U.S. a very competitive place to do business. To <PersonType>, competition is viewed as being \"clean, fair, and square\" in which both parties compete openly for the same prize.

{"prompt": "Suture and Staple Removal\n\nPatients usually see the family or general practitioner for suture removal following laceration repair from an injury. In many offices, it is the medical assistant\u2019s responsibility to remove the sutures or staples. It is vital to check the emergency center\u2019s report regarding the number of sutures or staples put in so you can be sure to remove all of them.\n        Be sure to remove the same number of sutures or staples as were inserted by the provider. Sutures or staples that are not removed can become infected, so care in removing all the material is vital. Occasionally patients report that one or two stitches have already come out during a bandage change at home. This should also be noted in the patient\u2019s chart. Follow the steps in Procedure 48\u20134 for suture or staple removal. Removal of staples is performed with a staple extractor as described in the procedure for removal. Before you remove the sutures or staples, check the number of days the provider who put them in recommended as the time to wait before removal. Ask the provider to inspect the healing wound. After the sutures or staples have been removed, providers might order additional closure materials to cover healing incisions or lacerations (Figures 48\u20134A, B, C, and D). A support skin closure might be necessary to keep the skin together until the wound is completely healed.

Oh God, she'd adored <Person> and her piss had tasted like nectar as it splashed and dribbled all over her face - she just couldn't gulp enough of it to satisfy her desires. And the thrill of standing over a naked <Person>, opening her legs and emptying herself over her lover was almost too much to bear. She was so in love with <Person> - it was if her gushing pee was actually carrying her love and covering <Person> in her desire. Such memories, but such heartache when <Person> had to move away that fall. She thought she'd die sobbing. . . <Person> knew she couldn't allow herself another session on the bed, but she gave into another temptation. Her smooth pussy had excited her, so she fetched out the camera and took plenty of photos of her lovely nude body. Many were very explicitly concentrated on her cunt, both closed like a little girl's and gently spread to allow her inner lips to flower again. Others were of the whole of her, both standing in front of the mirrors in the bedroom and posing on the bed. By using the delay, she could take nice pics of herself from behind as she kneeled and spread her legs. She'd look at them when she was alone. Another excuse for a private session. . . She carefully saved the photos in her secret folder on the PC. God knows what she'd say if <Person> ever found them. It was a little sexy ritual she'd been doing for years. Heavens, tucked away carefully in her lingerie drawer she had Polaroids Candy had taken of her when she'd still been at school! God; <Person> would be so shocked to find those. He'd be so disappointed in her. . . And she knew what she was about to do. It was only sensible to check whether they were still safe. . . She felt to the back of her drawer and her finger closed around the packet with that familiar thrill. Just checking that they're still safe. . . Makes sense just to look inside to reassure herself that they're still all there. . . And there she was, from all that time ago. Her girly grin shining out down the years, love for her friend burning from her eyes. Kneeling on the bed, cupping her adolescent breasts (quite nice, even then, she noted!); here showing her butt and glistening pussy to <Person>; some more, close ups, with her fingers deep inside her; and then others, taken shortly after, with her licking her fingers. Nearly one hundred in total, documenting a few months' young love, exhibiting herself in eager but fairly unsophisticated poses for her beautiful lover. Oh God, even now <Person> could feel the ache in her belly. And here were the most explicit, taken only days before the crushing news that shattered that summer - a few pics of each of them licking the other's pussy. She remembered with a smile that they messed about with the camera's self-timer for ages to get those shots right - but she was still impressed with the results even now. The love shone out from their eyes and there was nothing posed about the enthusiasm - they couldn't have buried their mouths any deeper in their lovers' cunts. She could actually see <Person>'s juice glistening on <Person>'s nose in one shot. It was familiar, the mix of emotions whenever she took this journey back in time. Yes; her hand had strayed down and yes, her fingers were sticky again but it was almost a fondle for comfort. Of equal intensity was this longing, still, for a youthful intense love that had been denied them. True; she now enjoyed herself every week or so with India from the gym for a few hours but she knew that she'd never ever replace <Person> in her heart. That realisation served to put <Person>'s \"sensible head\" back on. She self-consciously gave a little cough; stood up sharply and gave herself a little talking to. Time was moving on and she had plenty to do to prepare for her special night with <Person>. To be continued. . . ", "S": 1, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 0, "S3": 1, "H2": 0, "V2": 0}

When I'm doing okay-ish it's usually more minor sh and manageable eating disorder thoughts, but when I'm not doing okay (basically since the start of 2020) I bounce between extremes. Had a bad 6 months of my worst sh, covering myself in permanent scars, and then decided to try and stop. It was okay for a bit but then slowly the ED started sneaking up again. Now I'm back in deep anorexia. I'm sure if I manage to get out of this I'll slowly move back to SH again. It's a never ending cycle, and I'm sorry you're experiencing these feelings too. Not eating can definitely be self harm. It's most definitely part of why I do it, though I have a other more ED related reasons too.\n\nSpeaking purely from my experience, dealing with an eating disorder is much more scary and much more deadly. They're also surprisingly easy to develop once you get into a food restriction mindset like this. Not that I want to recommend you go back to cutting, but if you can find alternatives or ways to try and cope that don't involve a restrictive diet I highly *highly* encourage it. Self harm is definitely very dangerous and it covered me in scars and shame, but I have a strong feeling this eating disorder is straight up going to kill me, either in a year because I don't recover or in 30 years because I do but my aging body can't handle all the damage not feeding it caused.", "S": 0, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 1, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 0}

Why not? Research shows that women have an especially difficult time maintaining desire in long-term, monogamous relationships. Yes, cheating is a moral failure because it violates trust, but it seems like it doesn't impact you that way, so why insist on feeling how others would feel? It's not ideal, but if she has a strong desire to have sex outside your relationship, but doesn't feel it could ever be permitted, there's only a few things that could happen: break up, cheat, suppress your desire. These are the options our culture shows us, and LOTS of people who choose option 3 wind up slipping into option 1 or 2 eventually, anyway, and often wind up inadvertently repressing their libido entirely, including for their partner, who they come to resent, like it or not. Why not figure out a new way? Whether or not it is desirable is another question. Only you can figure that out. As for how to approach here and where to start: use your words and start at the beginning. \"I know about your affair, but I don't feel about it the way you might think....\" Write it out if it's hard to say.

{"prompt": "As many different people mentioned the issue is what is supposed to make you happy and the goal and what your supposed to do. Being guys I think we are far more firm in our beliefs and loyal to them. Stubborn, and that has great benefit in many cases. Women on the other hand flip real quick. We are even mentally made to be what women need. Gives us purpose in some ways. But we arent supposed to be selfish so really in basically all aspects we are supposed to sacrifice for them. So in brief we naturally are stubborn, not selfish, and our purpose is to provide etc. This sadly makes us slaves. Eventually after enough abuse and inability to rationalize the massive work to get little or no happiness as a return common sense should take over. There is a book I read called No more mr. Nice guy and it was interesting because it's not that we arent selfish. We want happiness etc like everyone else but deep deep down we try to follow a path we were taught and expected to do which was supposed to get those things. The truth is. And it's very difficult to accept, is that putting in the work doesnt allways work. I havnt actually seen any guy ever in history getting what he put in or more. In fact what's really happening is a very bad choice of pursuing the dream when the dream actually doesnt exist. Once you can accept the dream doesnt exist, all the effort and time rationally just doesnt make any sense. I understood this years before I got divorced but I talked myself into thinking I needed self improvement in relationships. This really implied I sucked as a person and was a failure even further. So I tried. Read countless books. Counseling ,attempts to talk. None of it worked. The simple answer is because there was no reason for her to be better or change being a go because there is always someone who could pay or give her whatever crap she wanted then. Even more funny after divorce she finally broke down and admitted she was a piece of shit after I was fucking her like the ho she was when she got with new guy. This tells me a lot. They dont want to be better. They want to feel better. Hate to break it to you but that basically gives them free reign to do whatever they want to anyone and just jump on the next cock to feel good and not be judged. Try dating and talk about relationships and expectations etc. Works really poorly. Makes them feel like shit and being judged and compared. Go be goofy and laugh about stupid shit and dont talk about expectations or having to work and they will love you. Straight good feelings vs. Reality. They want a fantasy We want a reality.

Are you suggesting that the trending videos are not curated and that more popular but still ad-appropriate videos are not excluded? you're welcome to try and create a competitor as several other people have failed at, because that's the solution capitalism provides for you.

{"prompt": "People keep saying this. While it's not a bad idea, what we need is football medical teams actually doing their fucking jobs and looking out for their players. That, and grow some balls and stand up to their managers, and to the players themselves, and make the decisions that need to be made, regardless of how popular those might be. I know there's concerns about teams gaming the system if football were to implement some sort of HIA, where players are temporarily removed while they're assessed. More than anything, this just shows how appalling the attitude to injuries in football actually is, especially concussions. I say this as a physio working with professional rugby teams. Rugby probably leads the field in professional sports in regard to injury management and player welfare these days, especially when it comes to head injuries/concussion. We've had issues with faking injuries for competitive advantage at a professional level as well, but these were massive controversies, not regular occurrences. is the main one I'm referring to) It's unbelievably stupid to be putting a concussed player back on the field. Even if you were to ignore the obvious concerns about player safety, a concussed player is a liability from a tactical perspective as well. They're not thinking right, they're not going to react at the same speed, or in the same ways, as they usually would, and they're not going to be operating anywhere near 100%. There's literally no reason to be keeping these people on, especially in a big, high-stakes game like this. Karius was another example of this.

I have no idea what was really going on I thought I was crazy. I spent a lot of my early years being terrified to go to sleep! When I was 17 I stumbled upon lucid dreaming. I was very excited about it and I put a lot of effort into learning it in order to control the experiences I was having. I started off with m.i.l.d lucid dreaming becoming aware after the experience already starts itself through reality checks and dream signs.. after I got the hang of that I stumbled across W.i.l.d lucid dreaming. Which is creating the experience from scratch bringing your consciousness interview experience fresh aposed to recognizing it after it already starts. After I got a hold of that I stumbled into astral projection.. started practicing it and realized I never stopped practicing wake induced lucid dreaming... there are many different ways to go about achieving the state of consciousness, my favorite and most reliable is wake up don't move and Roll my Conciousness out of bed is my go to exit, its a bit to long to type out.on here I have a video up on it, here it is if u guys wana check it out this is the tecnique of been useing for years, it's a variation of w.i.l.d wake back to bed.. without actually getting up and staying up for x amount of time when I was younger I'd have 4 or 5 a night doing this im lucky to get 1 a night now maby 2, the older we get the harder this gets... do the the war on our Conciousness Via Heavy metals :( /cry THEY be crippling our spiritual glands, can't control a population of people that travel the stars every night !", "S": 0, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 1, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 1}

She was backing out of a spot and hit me broadside. I got out, didnt yell or anything, she apologized and gave me her insurance info. I didnt think much of the damage at the time as it was her paint on my step. We texted a few days later and I asked her if she had gotten a quote to fix her fiat. The bumper was ruined. She hadn't and mentioned she had been busy. I commented that I had been too. Well I tried wiping her paint from my step and it's not coming off. They're like rhino lined. I also found that when she backed into me it also damaged my wheel. So I got around to calling her insurance and filed claim. A couple hours later she texted me asking if I filed a claim. I said yes, her paint wouldnt scrub off and my wheel was damaged. I asked if that was an issue. ( had she nicely said yes, I would've asked if she wanted to handle it another way ) her response was that it was comical since she hit my step. Responded that it also damaged my wheel and asked if I shouldn't have filed a claim. Crickets in response. So, Am I the asshole? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he feels she isn\u2019t mature enough to be looking to buying something I\u2019m assuming only 18 years and up are allowed to buy (I know some you don\u2019t have to be 18 but that\u2019s a weird area and I\u2019m not an expert) then he should have every right to stop his child from viewing or trying to make purchases of adult toys. That\u2019s kinda like punishing a boy who was watching porn or something. Uwu porn bad because women are assulted and the sex isn\u2019t real. Maybe they would know that if they were older and more mature? So 100% the boy should punished and talked too. Just because guys have a helping hand and have an easier time orgasming doesn\u2019t excuse a 12 year old trying to purchase a vibrator. Even the non penetration ones in my bigoted opinion??? Idk I guess the non penetration ones are not 18+? Idk what the OP\u2019s daughter was trying to buy at that instance or what she was considering. Also, how did the girl even know what a vibrator was? Did her friends tell her? Was she watching porn and saw a woman masturbating with it? Would this girl continue exploring her sexuality and such in non safe ways including porn and might this have affects on her thought process when dealing with real life encounters? I\u2019m not saying buying a vibrator or dildo would make her more likely to have sex but it may have adverse affects her parents might not be aware of. The mom hailing the girl out and throwing her dad\u2019s authority as a co parent on the trash was not acceptable. Parenting is a two person job. (Normally at least) They should have talked behind closed doors and after however long it took, then together come out with a joint and unified position. Or all three of them sat down and talked about her actions, why she did what she did. Talk about healthy sex/sex ed? I do think it\u2019d be really weird buying your daughter a vibrator or son a pocket pussy or whatever and then knowing they\u2019re out there using it or whatever.

{"prompt": "No offense man but this is even worse than what we got 1\\. I'm ok with this one. Brienne 100% should have died this episode, agreed. Pod doesn't really matter but at least we get some more named characters to show the consequences. 2\\. There's no logical reason for Jon, Jaime, and Jorah to fight the white walkers. There were thousands of wights, they never even would have gotten close to the white walkers. And IMO, one of the best scenes was when Jon went to fight the NK and the NK just walked away. Because why the fuck would the night king want to fight Jon? He has nothing to prove, no personal beef with Jon. He has no care for these insignificant humans. That's what his wights are for. And why would he let the white walkers, his most important tools, go against people wielding a weapon that makes them disintegrate on contact? Ya it would have been cool to see Jorah fight a white walker, but it makes no sense. And if that's what this sub is arguing is the main problem with the show - spectacle over logic and characters - then this suggestion is awful. Also, Jorah has no reason to fight with the white walkers. He's not part of this story. His story is Dany and that's where he needed to be. Again, the other big complaint I've seen is that Arya was not part of the white walker story and it was Jon's arc to end the NK. But now you're taking Jorah out of his own story and putting him in Jon's. Also also, Jorah's death was one of the most powerful moments of the episode, not just because we lost a character we liked, but because we saw a character who said time and again that he would do anything for Dany complete his arc by fighting to the death to protect the woman he loves. It was the perfect end for his character. We feel nothing if Jorah is just backed up against a wall in some random fight with a white walker because there is no emotional depth to the fight. It only works if we can feel what they're fighting for, and the only thing Jorah would be fighting for is Dany. 3\\. Meh. More dragon fighting is always good. But I liked Dany's swordfighting. It shows her bravery and perseverance to do what little she can to help Jorah. And it's an interesting contrast to Sansa, first in their role (Dany is the dragon queen and fights with the armies, while Sansa is a political leader and at this time can do nothing but try and keep people calm, like Cersei during the Battle of the Blackwater) and later in their response to danger (Dany picks up a sword and fights, Sansa runs and hides). And it's not even like it was unbelievable; she occasionally awkwardly poked a wight that was busy fighting Jorah. 4\\. Nope nope nope. Arya getting air was not the problem with this episode. At all. Seriously, it's not a fucking issue that the trained assassin can sneak up on the white walker. There were other major problems with this episode, this isn't one of them. There's no reason to show us that, yes, this super sneaky ninja that we saw doing super sneaky ninja shit 20 minutes ago did some more super sneaky ninja shit.

The only election they actually won was in 1976, against Ford, by less than 1%, because Ford pardoned Richard Motherfucking Nixon. The Democratic party was essentially dead. Urbanization gave massive electoral gains to the Republican party as the Democratic power base was concentrated entirely in urban areas. In order to have ***any chance of winning at all***, the Democrats had to shift right. Now you want them to shift left again, and guarantee a loss in the electoral college? What the hell are you smoking? Yes, in an ideal world, we should go left. That's where the facts, the empathy, the compassion, the science, and the realism lie. But that's not where America's voters lie. I'm sorry, they just don't. You go left, you guarantee the Republicans sweep all three branches again.

A life is better than no life, sure it may not but as great as others, but it\u2019s a life, which is better than being aborted. What if they are too poor?

They communicate this to me through moans, speech, or some other method of letting me know what I\u2019m doing is working. This could also put her at ease.

As much as you may want to depending on her position, don\u2019t put your hand on her head or push her down in anyway since it\u2019s her first time.

It'll take me another 2-3 months to complete all PvE challenges in E7, as I'm not being obsessed about it. Besides your main point was PvE was not fun, now you changed it to not updated often enough. How this is even valid cons on gachagaming to people who didn't try E7 yet and have hours of content to burn trough? And how does it make that content not fun? Seems like I were spot on and you are just some hardcore guy who has way too much time on his hand and got bored with E7. Did that made you so angry you went with bolds? xD Dude it's okay that you don't like it/has not enough content - play just something else.

I didn\u2019t want to give out any information (her account, her name, etc.) so I kept it as vague as possible. He then started to badger me to give him the account.

{"prompt": "Okay, so you don't understand how curves work. Let's say the class is hard and no one cheats. The class average comes out to 60%. The department requires a class average of 75%. The professor does some fancy math (z-scores, std dev, etc.) unless they're lazy, then they just add 15% to everybody's score. A score of 59% (an F) becomes a 74% (a C). The kid that looked like they were failing is actually doing fine because the class is hard and no one is really doing that well. Now, take that same scenario. Except this time there are cheaters. They raise the class average to 72% because of their artificially inflated grades. Now the curve is only 3%. Now it looks like the kid with a 59% only gets a 62%. Seems like he's dumb. In reality, though, the class is hard. No one gets it. Of course the professor isn't curving down. The only professors that do that are monsters. The point is, a raw D or F can actually be good for a class. My senior year of college I took biophysical chemistry. Our class average on the final was 56%. It was the highest average on the final in the past 5 years. It doesn't mean we were stupid, just that the class is hard. Artificially inflating the curve is a complete dick move.

This guy said \"she left me because I'm transgender and she's'not a lesbian'\" and then a bunch of other commenters jumped in saying \"fuck her\" etc. (Most seem to be deleted now, but one is still there). The argument they were making is that she should \"try\" to be a lesbian. So i replied with \"have you tried not being transgender\". As a gay man i know that sometimes your body makes choices for you, but the culture prevalent on reddit is one that not only victimises the lgbtq community but vilainzes straight people. Growing up all i wanted to be is normal. Sure i wanted to eat a bunch of dick and still do, but i just didn't want to be treated differently.good or bad for that fact. Arguing that the transgender commenters girlfriend should had stayed with him is bad. A culture that put pressure on that kind of forced acceptance is a certain kind of rape.

Yes they don't make a profit from making skins for lower played champions but they're a multi-million dollar company. In this case, the profit matters less compared to the backlash they continually get for not making a single skin for over 3 years for one champion. If they had a patch with skins for all the champions that haven't gotten one in years then everyone would be satisfied. Why won't they do that instead?

{"prompt": "*\"My dear, your chariot awaits\"* I rehearsed in my refined voice. I sounded like a regular Jeeves, which was good, because on most days I sounded like a regular trash compactor. It had taken weeks for me to build up the courage to ask Emma out on this date, and given the frequency with which Murphy's Law has its way with me my only course of action was to engineer it to be perfect. Thus, I performed my final practice run before the night began. *\"My dear, your chariot awaits.\"* With my piece perfected and a deep breath, I rang the buzzer and waited for the click. \"Hey dipshit, want to go for a ride?\" I buried my face in my hands until the sound of her footsteps on the stairwell grew nigh, only ceasing to chide myself when she came into view. Emma was stunning in a what-the-hell-is-she-wearing sort of way, with waist-length black hair, a pleated grey dress, and Lennon lenses big enough to serve appetizers on. Her lip-biting smile made my heart do gymnastics, and it was all I could do to keep my jaw above the ground. \"So, where to?\" she asked taking a leisurely pace beside me as we made out way to the car. \"There's a food festival downtown that I've been waiting to check out. Great food, live music, tastes and scents and sounds from the four corners of the globe packed into the space of one park. Tonight is going to be off the \u2013\" My foot crunched on safety glass as we neared the sedan, and when I caught eye of where it had come from, the two of us stopped dead in our tracks. There was a hole in the window, basketball-sized, and all around and across the freshly cleaned seats were plexiglass shards the size of diced onions. Nothing was missing and no alarm was going off, but in the back a dark shape moved \u2013 menacing, destructive and utterly indifferent. \"What up,\" Jean said with complete nonchalance, \"Either of you want a Toblerone?\" \"I hope you don't mind,\" Emma said as she opened the door \u2013 the rear door I might add \u2013 \"it seemed weird that you forgot to invite him. Usually you're the deliberate one.\" \"I *am,*\" I grunted as I slid into the driver's seat. \"Jean, mind giving us some breathing room?\" \"You're the boss,\" he said, rolling down the window. I sighed. With that, I backed out of the parking space, and the three stupidest fucks began their stupid-ass journey. &amp;#x200B; Ah, oysters, the snot rockets of love. It's amazing to think in our industrial age that father of pearls would have ever found its home in the rivers of the fair city of New York. They are a feast of salt and sea, a luxury served raw on the half shell, or baked with bread crumbs and parmesan for a certain ragtime appeal. They're rustic but refined, a treat meant to be savored with a single gulp. They are not meant to be eaten the way Jean just did, which involved bringing the shell to his nose, and snorting it like a fat line of coke. The crowd cheered and Emma gave a whistle of encouragement while I sunk deeper into my glass of seasonal horchata and popped another ball of takoyaki into my mouth. The mix of cinnamon and tonkatsu sauce was an unexpected delight, but in my heart I was miserable, and my mouth dwelled not on the pleasures of taste. Emma pulled up beside me with a heavily annotated map. \"I've got a chart plotted out for the vendors to hit. If we stop here for the spicy lamb noodles and then order Bolivian Llama Party while we wait, we'll have a 35 second window to get limeade to boot.\" I finished the last bite and picked at a crumb with the toothpick. \"There's three of us now so couldn't we divide and conquer.\" I tried to keep the bitterness out of my voice, but as with most things I failed miserably. \"Jean seems to have drawn a crowd now so we should probably let him do his thing.\" She wasn't wrong about that. The people chanted \"*Snort!\"* in unison with the earnestness few could muster for their own kid's little league. \"Beside,\" she said softly, \"I wanted to make some time for the two of us.\" That caught my attention. Had she realized what she was doing and planned it to let me down easy? It was a level of social nuance I wouldn't have expected of Emma, but the things she was able to figure out always had a way of surprising me. There was nothing I could do to make this situation any less painful, so after a half second of consideration I decided to just get it over with. \"Yeah? How come?\" \"I wouldn't have noticed it if Jean hadn't told me, but I realize now there's someone you're in love with. I don't pay very good attention, but I know the way you go about things. I figure by now you've probably already asked her out and already have a whole relationship arranged. I know when that happens we were going to be seeing less of you, so I wanted to make sure we still had our little moments together. Is that alright?\" \"That's not\u2013\" I was dumbfounded. Relieved but flabbergasted. Not noticing was one thing, but that she was this close and yet that far off the mark left me unsure how even to respond. \"\u2013just who did you think this girl was? How many other girls do I interact with on a daily basis?\" \"Well, there's Kat for one thing.\" \"Kat is Jean's sister, Emma! She's *twelve*! Were you expecting me to pull Neverland Ranch out of my ass? I didn't ask her out! I didn't ask *anyone* out! The only person I was trying to go on a date with was **YOU**!\" \"Oh,\" a voice said behind me, \"oh shit.\" I must have shouted that last word, because momentarily I realized the oyster bar had gone silent, and every pair of eyes \u2013 Jean's included \u2013 was locked on us. \"Okay, wow. I, uh... Okay, now not inviting me makes a whole lot more sense. My bad?\" \"It's fine,\" I sighed. \"Want me to back off?\" \"That would be lovely Jean,\" I sighed again. I turned to Emma. \"Do you want to go too? I won't blame you if you do, but I was kind of hoping maybe...\" I didn't get to finish before she took my hand in hers and beamed at me. \"Cool,\" Jean said, \"I guess I'll drive back and see you guh-uhh\u2013\" He paused and then sneezed out a shucked oyster the size of my fist. \"\u2013later.\" and then there were two of us. \"So you were mentioning an optimal snack route?\" I said satisfied. \"Optimized, not optimal. But it should be good enough.\" She beamed up at me, and for the first time that night I finally felt at peace. It had been rough going. There had been many miscommunications and far too much stupidity for it to have ever been a good night, but this? This was all right. In the end, Murphy's Law really did a number on me, but at the end of the night it all worked out. The only casualties were a few phlegmy oysters, and one smashed car window. \"Hey, wait a minute,\" I said suddenly, \"Jean said he was going to drive back, right?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Didn't we come here in my car?\"", "S": 0, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 1, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 1}

I think a lot of times women's perception and the idea of flirting someone into the friendzone is completely defined by the patriarchy and society pressures that are glamourized/romanticized by Hollywood. Deep down though.. you expressing it anonymously is an indication you are seeking validation for something. Sorry, real talk there...but I think that's something to be very careful with! I would like to ask you... Have you been in a long term relationship? Or been in one where you were emotionally intimate with someone and not just attracted to them? Can you yourself define emotional intimacy for you? Also have you ever had a dude that you \"friendzoned\" like flip out on you or anything? Or confess their undying love for your beautiful soul? Because I think that would be more of an indicator of you just being friendly not necessarily \"leading\" a guy on. Because flirting should really be made with the intention that it's easy to read that you want physical something with them. Have you ever hung out with theatre people? There is a reason why movies make fun of the horny art kids. Anyways, overall I really do hope you know that it's ok to be shy, it's ok to have platonic friendships with the opposite sex and it's cute that you are shy. You will have to learn how to own it but find ways to get your closest confidants to help you. Try a night out with one of your more bubbly friends that can talk to random people and help you out..but make sure it's someone you trust and you aren't babysitting them because they drink too much. Most of my girl friends and I take turns going out with the intent of helping one particular girl in the group out. And to be honest, since I'm ok with chatting with strangers I usually wing woman for friends and don't pull that mean girls Regina George bullshit because we all have different attractions. But that introduction usually breaks the ice enough for my shy friend to say hi and do the initial small talk. But like assess your girl friends for real before you ask them.", "S": 0, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 1, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 0}

{"prompt": "Hi Adam, You\u2019ve certainly had a lot of experience with psychedelics and have encountered many others life changing experiences! Q1. My question is, have you know of any cases where psychedelics have lead to unwanted permanent dysfunction? I\u2019m only asking because there seems to be a lot of talk on the positive long term effects but not a lot of negative long term effects. This probably won\u2019t stop me taking acid lol, I\u2019m simply looking to understand all sides of this wonderful substance :) Also from my experience the short term (that feels forever lasting) hell before reaching heaven has always seems to come from some sort of internal conflict I\u2019ve not been facing or have been hiding myself so well it seems like it should have been obvious in the first place... Q2. do you think this is (at least one of the reasons) why people have bad trips? Lastly I want to share two lsd related experiences The first being, after a come down I went out the back of the student accommodationist was staying at to have a cigarette to ease myself from the trip... Back Story! Not needed! (one of my roommates thought it would be funny to completely fuck with me by tapping on me repeatedly and pretending like he didn\u2019t, it took everyone else to catch on to what he was doing and thought I was crazy and made me question my sanity deeply, I shouldn\u2019t have trusted myself around him on lsd as he\u2019d previously gaslit with me and in general was a manipulative and degrading self centred piece of shit who puts people down to feel good) ... walking back there was a rough looking gentle man who look like he had taken some mind altering drug him self, I looked him in the eyes and he stared right back and shouted at me to \u2018get of his head!\u2019 which how I felt in connection to him. (This isn\u2019t even the crazy story) Story two, last week, Completely sober walking through Newcastle a lady who seemed very high on life said \u201cI know\u201d I dreaded what she was going to ask next, I felt it coming \u201cwhat do you know?!\u201d I asked anyways... \u201cyou\u2019ve taken psychedelics\u201d No, No, No, No! (Well yes I have) But OMG, this blew my fucking mind harder than tripping its self, the fact I\u2019m not tripping, this wasn\u2019t funny, in fact this scared the shit out of me, a complete stranger knew just looking at me! Please tell me I\u2019m not the only person to experience this! (Just for context I blend into my non psyched peers pretty well and only tripped twice before, I\u2019d say even in terms of expression as much as appearance, in other words... as far as I\u2019m concerned, no indication of psychedelic use) She just knew and again it was like feeling that connection bursting from my chest pulling their conscious into mine. Euphoric. Even with the other encounter. Euphoric. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d I asked her... She elaborates on how it\u2019s like everyone else is sleep walking and she can tell because I was awake... not completely but definitely awake.

Arya, from a location on the wall sees Jon is 1v1 w/ NK and goes to assist. During the fight, Jon loses to NK but has him wounded and pinned down. At this time dany and dragon arrive and Jon is screaming for her to burn him and NK (yes, dragon fire kills NK). Dany looks terrified and indecisive knowing she has to kill Jon to save everyone. Cut to aryas POV just to see Drogon light them up killing both Jon and NK. Arya essentially believes Dany killed 2 birds with one stone - NK dead and she\u2019s taken out her main competition in the North (and iron throne although she doesn\u2019t know that) Next day, battle is over and won. Arya is missing and presumed dead. Everyone is uncertain as to how it all ended but find jons torched body. Accusations fly. Bran/Sam break the news of Jons parentage which ultimately brings Sansa and the North in line b/c it\u2019s what Jon would\u2019ve wanted and he was true king Move to KL. Everyone is preparing for the war. Jaime is in his tent putting on his armor and looking in the mirror contemplating everything and what might end up happening with Cersei. A breeze of wind blows through his door and he looks back to see nothing. War begins, Cersei loses (Jaime kills her) dany is on the throne. Cut to bran in winterfell talking with Sansa about everything that\u2019s happened. He gives a voiceover and it\u2019s revealed that he wargged into drogon and killed Jon to defeat the NK(dany never said \u201cdracarus\u201d). Jaime is shown as captain of the queens guard, Tyrion is hand. Dany learns that\u2019s she\u2019s pregnant. The final scene is her letting Tyrion know she\u2019s pregnant with jons child. Tyrion goes to leave the room as Jaime enters and he has a brief chat and notices somethin strange about his golden hand as he walks toward Dany. Tyrion has a confused/concerned look on his face and then realizes something and looks back. End of show. (idk something basically to make the viewer think that Arya may have actually killed Jaime in his tent, stole his face, took out Cersei and now is going to take out dany but it\u2019s left a mystery).

Yes people sit on headys in bo4 I do it all the time, but on bo4 you can peek without getting instakilled or even fight back against someone on a heady. This is because of the increased TTK. For example U and elbow in bo4. If you tried peeking that on mw3 or even bo2 you would be instakilled without a chance. But in bo4 I've seen people win that gunfight. Also the 2 saug argument is the most stupid thing you have said. Are you saying that bo4 discourages aggressive gameplay? The reason only 2 people use the saug is because it is ass.

{"prompt": "I was 16 and dealing with some hard times. For one, my grandmother died from cancer a few years before, which hit me hard. Moreover, I had just moved out from under my mom\u2019s roof because they wanted to move across the city and I wanted to stay where I was at. I ended up staying with some friends after that. I knew next to nothing about world religions at the time except that I was raised Episcopalian. One day while driving home from school, I noticed a building off in the distance that I had never seen before. Curious, I decided to go scope it out. It was a odd looking oriental building. As I drove down the long gravel drive, I noticed that no other cars were there. But still, I decided to explore it. I parked and got out and walked around a statue garden. Then I approached the giant front doors and sat there a minute debating what to do. Then I slowly opened one of the large wooden doors and poked only my head in. To my surprise there stood a small bald female monk. She invited me in and we began talking. I asked all about what the building was and she asked about me and who I am. That first conversation lasted several hours as we shared our stories. I found out it was a Buddhist temple (Fo Guang Shan tradition). I was intrigued and was invited to come back. So I did. The next weekend I was back. We started talking about Buddhism and meditation. As it turned out, I spent nearly every weekend for the following two years learning and meditating in the temple under the instruction of two monks (one being the one I first met). It helped me immensely. I came to terms with the impermanence of life. I also learned a lot about suffering, attachment, and of course the dharma as a whole. I wouldn\u2019t be who I am today without that experience. Just shy of my 19th birthday, I joined the military and left home. (Big big switch going from non-violent Buddhist to pounding sand in Iraq, I know). But I carried with me all that I learned in those two years prior. And it helped me process and deal with many of the stressors and losses I would later find myself in front of.

{"prompt": "What I'm annoyed at is that the political statements in major games are about anything but what the player believes in so as to not cause controversy. Bioshock deals with political ideologies, its considered an example of a game exploring politics well. But no one is seriously advocating for creating an a Randian Objectivist or a puritanical theocratic society, we dont live in either one so its not challenging the status quo. Metal Gear deals with topics like the military industrial complex, mercenary armies and nuclear/military tech proliferation... Is advocating for these things actually a mainstream political stance though? At least this is applicable to real life, but its not exactly the player doing these things in real life, its government. Deus Ex Mankind Divided was about a mechanical apartheid. Is anyone seriously for that though? The creation of apartheid's is a fringe opinion now... Though that didn't stop the game from having a weak stance on the issue anyway, despite being the oppressed class in this system it never really impacts on you the player. All these games use political topics as just window dressing yet they are held up as the gold standard of how to do politics in games. They serve as thought pieces but don't challenge any of the player base's beliefs. Its telling that these big idea games avoid controversy yet others get snagged on small incidental things, a main character is gay, a woman is on the box, a character is trans, etc. Because mundane political stances like 'gay people exist and are worthy of empathy' actually challenges beliefs that are widely-held. Or if the game has potential for political messaging... its just not acknowledged. Prison Architect is about running a for-profit prison, the mechanics push you too make cells small as possible, to feed them as worse as you can, to work them as much as possible, to lower the number of appeals necessary before execution. This is a game ripe with potential anti-capitalist messaging, how rational pursuit of profit leads to cruelty, the game could have focused itself around this... except its just never acknowledged. Offworld Trading Company is similar in this respect, the game ends once you get a monopoly on all the resources needed to run a Mars colony, a capitalists ultimate goal and wet dream, yet what logically happens afterward isn't acknowledged.

{"prompt": "Lemme see... - Link is the protagonist, yes. Zelda has been a protagonist a few times, but is mostly a supporting character. Originally, there was an ancient hero who helped the Goddess Hylia defeat and seal away the Demon-King Demise. Both were later reincarnated as Link and Zelda respectively during Skyward Sword. - Ganon is the reincarnation of Demise, the antagonist of Skyward Sword which takes place before every other game in the series. Demise is a true demon, hatred incarnate and, after being defeated by that era's Link, cursed himself, Link, and Zelda to forever be reincarnated in an endless battle of good vs evil. So Ganon could technically be a good guy at first, but would inevitably succumb to hatred and try to destroy/rule the world. - Ganon's Forms: Demise: OG big bad, hatred incarnate. Killed by Link and reincarnated as Ganon due to curse. Ganondorf: Human version of Ganon, typically born as a Gerudo. His goals have never been 100% clear and he's even had some sympathetic moments, but he's still Demise-reincarnated and will always fight Link at the end of the day. Ganon/Beast Ganon: The monstrous \"true form\" of Ganondorf. It's depiction has varied from a sentient, more powerful transformation, to a mindless, feral beast who wants nothing more than to eat you alive. Ganondorf typically transforms into this as a last ditch effort in battle. Calamity Ganon: After years, and decades, and centuries, and millennia of constant defeat, Ganon completely snaps and transforms into this eldritch form of pure hatred and malice. While somewhat sentient, CG wants nothing more than to destroy the whole world and everyone in it, starting with Hyrule. - The Ganon-Blights are separate from the Champions. They are what happens when Calamity Ganon corrupts the Divine Beasts with Malice, creating \"mirrors\" of the Champions to physically combat and kill them. The Blights are more or less \"off-spring\" of Calamity Ganon itself and not really related to the original Ganon form.

All ready to go, so I can just weigh out some meat and frozen veggies on a plate and microwave. Keep meals simple. Meat and 1-2 veggies. Omelets of any type. Track your meals in advance. Heck, if it's easier, weigh out the meat and veggies into ziplock bags or storage containers you can nuke as needed. Buy frozen pre-cooked meats if it's easier. You want it as easy as possible. Then-- dive in. Make your next meal keto. Make your next day keto. DON'T cheat--go cold turkey on sweets and treats. It really sucks for about 2 weeks, then, for most, it gets easy. Track, stay under 20g net, get your protein, let the fats fall where they may, don't feel you need to force them. If you need more to stay full, sure. Just stay under the fat macro. beyond that, it's simply about commitment and how badly you want to change, because if you don't really want to change it doesn't happen.

The only solution would be to violate our constitution, which, being America, will never happen. Some states do have reasonable gun control. Others don't have any. It won't do a damn thing.

{"prompt": "I just got back this past weekend. Feel free to ask me anything. Here are some things that we packed: * Colace (or similar stool softener) - The drugs they give you make you constipated. These will help * Dresses * Duster * Comfy Shorts * PJs * Underwear * Socks * Robe * Sandals * Advil/Ibuprofun * Tylenol * GasX * Blister bandaids * Tums * Travel Tissues * Adaptors * USB battery pack * Phone Chargers * Eye Mask * Travel Pillow * Toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush, etc) * Entertainment (laptop, switch, kindle, etc) Things to buy once you get there: I stayed in the Dusit Princess. You\u2019ll only have a kettle and a mini fridge as far as kitchen essentials go. Some easy \u201cmeals\u201d I ended up making: * Miso Soup (Super necessary for the bowel cleanse process) * If you don\u2019t have a chance to buy this on your own the hotel can provide it and it\u2019s literally called \"Operation Soup\". * Ramen, Bok Choy, Carrots * Fruit, Cheese, Prosciutto, Bagel Chips * PB&amp;J * Meat &amp; Cheese Sandwiches * Hummus, Tomato, Turkey, Lettuce pita pockets * Apples &amp; Peanut Butter * Cereal In order to make better hotel room soup I chopped all my veggie and put them in a bowl with dried ramen and the seasoning, boiled the kettle and poured the hot water over everything then covered the bowl with a plate for 5 minutes. Pack a fuck ton of things you\u2019ll actually want to eat after surgery. The first day you\u2019re back at the hotel (until the packing comes out) you\u2019re on a soft foods diet. So think soft granola bars (bonus points if they\u2019re high in fiber), instant oatmeal packs, etc. Breakfast is free for you to order at the hotel but all other meals are on your dime. The hotel is right next to a MASSIVE shopping mall, Seacon. If you need food the entire top floor is restaurants (though there\u2019s food throughout the entire mall). There is a Tops (grocery store) on the basement floor. You go in the entrance closest to the hotel. Just passed the food court is an elevator down and it looks like you're going into the mattress department at Macy's. You take a left and walk towards electronics and then make a right and you'll see all the groceries. It's a very strange setup. Go to Daiso. It\u2019s in Seacon, in the center of mall on the 2nd floor. You can get a soup bowl, plate, spoon, cutting board, knife, etc. Most importantly you can get a tray to eat food in bed or set your laptop on and it\u2019s all super cheap. Download the Grab app. It\u2019s like Uber, UberEats, and Prime Now all in one. You can order food, groceries, and get a ride at a set price instead of worrying with taxis running the meter. Not all of the restaurants have their menu in English so you\u2019ll have to hunt a little bit.

{"prompt": "Things I have learned from playing other editions: * AD&amp;D: This is the closest to a real horror game I've experienced. The characters are fantastically frail, and the chances of freak deaths are ever present. The biggest problem? Cludging through rules that the more I tried to work through them only made me long for playing any other system. * 3e/3.5e/Pathfinder: The versatility of this edition is incredible, and it can be heaps of fun largely because of that. I am quite fond of it in part due to this being the system I started on. Problems were caused by having so many books, thousands of spells and feats, and altogether too much material (some of which was conflicting) to collate into something I could wholly remember or understand. There is such a thing as literally drowning in material. * 4e: I read through the rulebook, realized it was basically only a game for murder hobos and felt alienated. Put the book back down on the store shelf and walked away. * 5e: Initially it felt over simplified and I thought I would feel suffocated by the lack of options. Having been part of the playtest and having enjoyed that, I decided I'd give it a go after managing to convince my play group to do it as well. The game shares many of the mechanics of 3e, but gets rid of the ones nobody could remember, and otherwise streamlines things. The fear of oversimplification in character options was largely quelled as I was making a character and found myself surprisingly fond of what they had done. What really sold me though was that we weren't spending 20% of any given game session looking up rules. * GURPS: Yes, it's not D&amp;D, but I have a love/hate relationship with this system. Upside: You can do ANYTHING with this system. Downside: You can do ANYTHING with this system. I was part of a campaign in which we played \"Stuperheroes\" (Supers who were in many ways better off not being heroes, but still tried), and it was heaps of fun. In the end, I understand why a lot of people would be reluctant to try other systems. There is a sort of fear of the unknown thing that goes on, as well as the burden of trying to learn a whole new system.

{"prompt": "I'm torn because I do value precision of language, but this one really just does seem about pedantry. I really don't think it confuses people. I guess I have trouble imagining your examples being a real thing. I mean, from a vocal standpoint I'd never look up \"piano song\" *ever*. Schubert lieder or vocal works is just fine. Anyone looking for Schubert probably would know to look for such or more likely would be looking for a specific piece of rep. I also think those specifically shopping for CDs would know what they are looking for AND I suspect those publishing them might be a bit more precise in that case. That said... is that even a thing any more... I mean, I'm nearing 40... grew up before CDs were a thing and I can't remember the last time I don't think I've bought physical audio media in a decade or more. I feel like you have to genuinely reach to find an example where \"song\" really creates that much misunderstanding. I mean, I get it. There are turns of phrase that drive me batty. When someone say they could care less it makes my eye twitch, but I ultimately just have to let it go because there's no changing it. I find my old man self constantly finding the term \"piano sheets\" very odd. I literally wonder where that came from. All my time as a musician I'd never heard anything but sheet music as a term until I got on the internet and \"music sheets\" seems to be THE way people refer to it. I've also gotten irritated by the fact that \"beat\" has come to mean... shit... almost anything. Whatever backing track is playing behind a rap song... that's a beat. The hook to a popular song like \"Don't Stop Believin'\" I hear people say they love that beat. Similarly I hear high and low often used to refer to dynamics. Something is so \"low\" they can't hear it... because it's quiet. Then pitch ends up defined by being deep instead of low. These are things that *actually* really confuse the language. I guess I feel like there are bigger fish to fry. I've never run into someone who is legitimately confused by the use of the word song. At best it's someone from a classical background (as I am for what it's worth) who busts out a \"Whell... akctually!!!\" They knew what was meant and are now corrected it for no useful purpose. Descresendo is another one of those words that just may as well be the accepted term. Technically diminuendo is the only correct way to say it, but that doesn't stop anyone from using decrescendo. Or what about the pronunciation off mezzo. Even trained vocalists who have impeccable diction training in half a dozen languages and know better still just go with the flow and say it wrong. It just doesn't really matter. Song is definitely one of those words like mezzo or decrescendo that doesn't *really* confuse almost anyone. It just puts a bee in the bonnet of a very small handful of people. And all cards on the table, those same types of people I disagree strongly with on many other things because it's usually those types who are also the interpretation police, think there is a small number of proper ways to play given pieces, and tend to think pianists like Lang Lang are destroying classical music. --- Another one for the road. When did aesthetic start being pronounced astetic? This is another one that bothers me but I've just had to let go. A ton of people use it and I wonder if there's a source... like some film studies professors who says it at a big school that everyone went to so they all copied him and now every one in the arts criticism scene says astetic instead of aesthetic. And why is TH fronting a thing, particularly for those without an *actual* speech impediment. This one is at least interesting if you talk to linguist because they say the TH is actually the weird thing and should actually eventually go away in favor of f and v sounds... which is a dystopian nightmare to me...", "S": 0, "H": 0, "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 0, "S3": 0, "H2": 0, "V2": 0}
